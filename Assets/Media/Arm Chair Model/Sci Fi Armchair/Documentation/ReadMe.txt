Usage:


The armchair prefab is located in Assets/New Axis Studio/Sci Fi Armchair/Prefabs.

Simply drag the prefab into your scene.

A demo scene is included containing a basic setup.



Substance Materials:


By default, the armchair has the standard material applied.

The substance material is found in Assets/New Axis Studio/Sci Fi Armchair/Materials/Substance Materials.

To apply a substance material to an object, open associated substance material dropdown and drag the Main_Graph material onto the object. Select the object, in the inspector you will now see the substance component, click on the Graph button to reveal the parameters.

Color options allow for changing the colors of various sections of the object.

Aging: Adds discolouration to the model.

Under Patterns, you will see a drop down for each section of the object that can have a pattern applied.
After selecting a pattern you will see additional parameters.

Pattern color: Change the color of the pattern. An alpha value of zero will hide fade the color completely.

Pattern Roughness: Use negative values for smoother results and positive values for rough results. A value of zero will show no results. NOTE: To see the updated roughness value you may have to click off the object for it to load.

Pattern Normal: Use to add positive or negative pattern normal strength. A value of zero will show no results. 

Pattern Scale: Increase this value to scale the pattern size up or down.

Pattern Offset: Use this value to offset the pattern across both x and y axis.

Pattern Rotation: Use this value to rotate the pattern. A value of 1 is equal to a 360 degree turn.




General Notes: 


The substance materials will allow for a higher resolution than 2048 however this is not recommended as all input textures used are 2048. Smaller resolutions will work fine.

After clicking the texture baking option for the substance materials, you may have to click out of Unity, then click back in for Unity to import the textures.

With a substance graph selected, you will see in the inspector a button named Reset Preset to Default, use this to restore the material to the default look.
