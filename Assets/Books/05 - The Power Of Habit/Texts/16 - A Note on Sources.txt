<h2>A NOTE ON SOURCES</h2>



The reporting in this book is based on hundreds of interviews, and thousands more papers and studies. Many of those sources are detailed in the text itself or the notes, along with guides to additional resources for interested readers.
<t>In most situations, individuals who provided major sources of information or who published research that was integral to reporting were provided with an opportunity​—​after reporting was complete​—​to review facts and offer additional comments, address discrepancies, or register issues with how information is portrayed. Many of those comments are reproduced in the notes. (No source was given access to the book's complete text​—​all comments are based on summaries provided to sources.)
<t>In a very small number of cases, confidentiality was extended to sources who, for a variety of reasons, could not speak on a for-attribution basis. In a very tiny number of instances, some identifying characteristics have been withheld or slightly modified to conform with patient privacy laws or for other reasons.
