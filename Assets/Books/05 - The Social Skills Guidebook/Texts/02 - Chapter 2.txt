<h2>Addressing Some Common Challenges and Concerns about Working on Your Social Skills</h2>


<smallcaps>This chapter first covers</smallcaps> common practical challenges to improving your interpersonal skills; then it goes over some concerns people have about the process. 

<h3>Practical challenges</h3>

Even when you want to make changes in your social skills, the following challenges can make it hard to start, and continue, working on them. These barriers are all surmountable. 

<q1>"I want to practice my social skills, but I get drained quickly in certain situations."</q1>

It's not uncommon for people to quickly become mentally drained when they're socializing. They can handle a dinner party conversation for an hour or two, but after that they feel depleted, like they want to leave. After a few hours, they're too tired to properly listen to everyone and craft their responses. Afterward they usually need some downtime to recover from their interactions. 
<t>Getting drained easily can interfere with your ability to practice, or just stay out with friends as long as you'd like. From an "acceptable, but inconvenient, differences" perspective, you may also be annoyed when people don't understand you're wired this way; some less-sensitive people may give you a hard time when you want to take off from an event early, or they may take it personally when you look tired around them. 

<i>Short-term ways to feel less drained once the feeling has started to set in</i>

•<b>Have some caffeine to give yourself a quick burst of energy.</b> This suggestion especially helps if you're out late and you're feeling sleepy on top of being depleted from socializing.
•<b>Have a snack or full meal if you haven't had any food in a while.</b> Your energy levels can subtly slip if you've gone hours without eating. However, don't eat so much that you go into a food coma.
•<b>Wait until you get a second wind.</b> Tiredness tends to come in waves, and your energy will usually rebound if you can gut out the grogginess for twenty minutes or so.
•<b>Take mini-breaks to recover some of your energy.</b> Bathrooms are a classic hideout. At a bigger function, moving from the hectic indoors to a more low-key conversation outside may be enough to give you a breather.
•<b>Consciously throw yourself into another gear and try to re-engage with everyone.</b> After you've started feeling drained, it's easy to give in to those feelings and sit back, zone out, and wait until you can go home. Hanging back and doing nothing is dull and usually makes you even more tired and checked out. Instead, try to find a fun interaction to join, which may perk you up and make you feel more enthusiastic.
•<b>If you know about a draining event ahead of time, take a strategic nap beforehand so you'll have more energy.</b>

<i>Becoming less susceptible to feeling drained over the long term</i>

Even taking the above suggestions into account, you can only do so much to hold back the drained feeling after it's already started. Here are some things you can do to reduce your tendency to get socially drained over a long haul:

•<b>Get more proficient at socializing in the situations that tire you out.</b> Anything is more mentally taxing if you're unpracticed at it. Also, you'll start to feel drained and disengaged more quickly if you're bored and not having a good time. As you get more skilled at handling a situation, it will easier to have fun in it.
•<b>Get more comfortable in the situations that tire you.</b> Anxiety is very physically and mentally draining. When you're more relaxed in a situation you won't waste your energy feeling tense and worried.
•<b>Over time push yourself to stay in social situations longer and longer.</b> You can "exercise" to build up your social endurance. When you're out with friends and want to take off, tell yourself you'll stick around for another half hour, and then later, an hour or more. After you've decided to stay, actively socialize rather than retreating to wait out the clock.
•<b>Hang around people who are more your style.</b> You'll be more prone to feel drained if you're with people who you don't have much in common with and are either too dull or too go-go-go for you.
•<b>Be around people more often.</b> Everyone has a baseline level of social contact they prefer, but it has some wiggle room. If you spend a lot of time alone, then when you do socialize, it's more of a shock to your system, and it won't be long before you want to be on your own again. If your life circumstances constantly put you around classmates, coworkers, family, and roommates, you get used to being around people constantly. Your need to escape and recharge doesn't totally go away, but your tolerance for having company is higher.

<q1>"I want to work on my social skills, but I just can't motivate myself to get started or stick with practicing for very long."</q1>

To improve your social life you need to be motivated to work on it, and push through the difficult patches. That motivation is sometimes hard to find even if you feel you logically <i>should</i> have it. There are a few reasons this can happen:

•<b>Your anxiety is holding you back.</b> It's only natural you'd want to avoid the kind of social practice that makes you nervous. At times you're well aware that you'd like to make changes but are too scared of getting rejected, embarrassing yourself, or having to dwell on your failures. At other times your anxiety will provide you with an excuse to procrastinate, like "I'll try to make more friends in the summer, when I'm not so busy with school."
•<b>If you have a personality where you have a lower need to socialize and are happy to be alone, you can get caught in a stagnant middle ground.</b> You wish your social life was better, but having to spend a lot of time on your own doesn't bother you <i>that</i> much, so you never feel enough of the pain or loneliness that lights a fire under you and compels you to make big changes.
•<b>Your goals aren't your own.</b> You may truly not care about improving aspects of your social skills at the moment, but have absorbed messages from society that you should want to address them. If you're younger, your family may be pressuring you to change before you feel ready.
•<b>You're not sure how to begin tackling your problems and are overwhelmed.</b>

<t>If you struggle with motivation, here are some things you can do:

•<b>Learn to handle your anxiety.</b> The book's next section goes into detail on this topic.
•<b>Accept that you may not be fully ready to change yet.</b> Regardless of how you think you should feel, your heart may not fully be in it at the moment. If you don't have an inner drive to tackle your issues, no rah-rah speech or quote is going to fix that. At best that'll make you feel psyched up for a day or two before you go back to the status quo. There's nothing wrong with deciding to wait until a greater sense of urgency sets in.
•<b>Set aside some time to figure out what you really want.</b> Are you telling yourself you should try to become an outgoing party animal because that's what society says is important, when deep down it doesn't interest you? Would you feel more enthusiastic about trying to develop a more low-key social life?
•<b>Realize the hardest part is often getting started.</b> After you're over that initial hump it will feel rewarding to make progress.
•<b>Break your goals down into manageable chunks.</b> Rather than having a vague objective of "I'm so lonely" or "I'm so bad with people. I don't want to be like that anymore," try to define exactly what you'd like to change. Would you like to make three friends you see regularly? Would you like to be able to chat to your coworkers without feeling tongue-tied and self-conscious?
•<b>Focus on the next immediate step.</b> It's important to keep your long-term goals in mind so little hiccups don't discourage you. However, when it comes to motivation, your overall objective may feel impossible and overwhelming. You may not know where to start with "Have a full and rich social life," but it's easy enough to tackle "Step 1: Research some places in town where I may be able to meet people."
•<b>Don't try to work on every social skill or goal at once.</b> Figure out the few core things you'll need to get half-decent at to feel better about your social situation. Save all the smaller tweaks for later. For example, if you're shy and lonely, but okay at making conversation after you're past your initial nerves, focus on meeting new people and being able to feel comfortable enough to chat to them. Don't spread yourself thin by also trying to perfect your posture and use of humor.
•<b>Do what you can to practice socializing in ways that are fun and convenient.</b> There's no way to avoid feeling uncomfortable at all times, but as much as possible try to get your practice through types of interactions you'd enjoy anyway.
•<b>Alter your environment so it nudges you toward getting out and being social.</b> You could decide not to watch TV or play video games on the weekend, so you'll feel bored and look for something else to do. If you have a specific social task you're putting off, tell yourself you can't do certain fun things until you've completed it (for example, "I can't go on the Internet until I text Karen and ask her if she wants to hang out this weekend.").

<q1>"I'm too busy to work on my people skills."</q1>

Everyone gets really busy from time to time, and if you have more important priorities, there's nothing wrong with putting your social skills development on the back burner for a while. However, try to be honest with yourself about whether you're really too busy or if you're using that as an excuse. Don't hide behind a job or graduate program that has a culture that glorifies having no life. If you want to try to work around your hectic schedule, here are some ideas: 

•<b>Make socializing a priority.</b> Don't see it as something you'll get to if your schedule happens to work out.
•<b>Boost your energy level.</b> If being too tired to go out is the problem, a nap after work or class or a strategic dose of caffeine may be all you need to get your energy and motivation back.
•<b>Manage your time better.</b> Figure out ways to use your time more efficiently and free up some hours in the day, for example, by improving your study or assignment-writing skills.
•<b>Streamline your social life.</b> Tweak your social life so it's less time-consuming and fits into your schedule. For example, make plans to see your friends after work, when you're already downtown.
•<b>Spend quality time with people instead of hanging out aimlessly for hours on end.</b> For example, have a shorter conversation-filled dinner instead of spending an evening watching TV and barely talking.
•<b>Organize group activities.</b> If you don't mind that kind of thing, try to hang out with lots of people at once instead of catching up with every person individually.

<q1>"I don't think I can get past my social problems without an exhaustive structured roadmap with hands-on exercises for each subskill."</q1>

Some people like to have every step of a process spelled out before they feel ready to start. This book offers lots of details that you can apply to your life as you see fit, but the content still may not be as fine-grained as you'd like. Every author has to decide what to leave out so the book can stay at a reasonable length. If you want in-depth clarification on a specific topic, you can look for it elsewhere, perhaps from a book in the Further Reading section.
<t>Another possibility is you're not giving yourself enough credit to figure out how to improve on your own. To learn any complex skill, you need to know how to direct your own development at times. Everyone is different, and your needs aren't always going to fit a template. You need to know how to decide what to focus on and how to come up with your own practice exercises if none are available. As a side effect of being less socially successful, some people develop a sense of helplessness and passivity around the issue. They think, "I'm clueless at socializing. I could never figure out how to get better by myself. The only way I'll have a chance is if someone holds my hand every step of the way." Not so. Figuring out how to improve is something you have the ability to do.
<t>This is not to pooh-pooh the idea of having a detailed, personalized plan entirely. Just don't default to thinking you can't do anything without one. If you think having a personalized plan would benefit you, a counselor can help with that. 

<q1>"I feel like I'm a lost cause. I'm an especially bad case. I have too many factors stacked against me to ever get past my issues."</q1>

It's not uncommon to feel discouraged in this way. However, very few people are hopeless cases when it comes to their social skills. The ones who have limits on their potential have real impediments, like congenital intellectual deficits, lower-functioning autism, or significant mental health issues like severe schizophrenia. Even then, they can still make some improvements. If you're more typically functioning, you're more than capable of developing good social skills, even if it takes a while. 
<t>When people see themselves as a hopeless case, the biggest barrier that prevents them from getting over their problems is, ironically, their belief that they're a lost cause. If you actively, consistently work on your issues, it may be tough at times, but you'll overcome them eventually. However, if you give up and don't do anything to address your problems, they are guaranteed to stay with you. Chapter 5 goes into more detail about how you can identify and dispute some of the beliefs that may be feeding this sense of being beyond help. 

<q1>"I have Asperger's syndrome​/​mild autism, which makes it harder for me to improve my social skills."</q1>

Asperger's syndrome is an inborn condition on the mild, higher-functioning end of the autism spectrum. Those who have it find socializing more difficult in a variety of ways. However, Asperger's is relatively rare, and most people who struggle socially don't have it. Appendix A goes into detail about the challenges Asperger's can cause and provides some approaches for working on your social skills if you have the condition. 

<h3>Concerns about the idea of working on your people skills</h3>

A fear of having to change too much and sell out to do better socially is a common concern. This book has already touched on some of these worries, and here are some more:

<q1>"I'm not sure if I want to work on my people skills. I don't lead a very social life, and I'm happy with it."</q1>

Odds are you're reading this book because you're motivated to change your social situation. However, maybe you're feeling more ambivalent. Maybe someone bought this book for you, and you're noncommittally flipping through it. 
<t>If you're content with your current social situation, this book isn't going to try to persuade you to change. However, it's important to make that decision with full self-awareness and honesty. Issues like anxiety, discouragement, and past resentments over being picked on or overlooked can cloud your motivations. You can trick yourself into believing you don't want what you think you can't have. 
<t>If you want to spend all of your time at home and not have many friends, and you've arrived at that choice with a clear head, that's fine. If you think you want to live a mostly solitary life because a) your anxiety has gotten out of hand, b) you're convinced no one would like you if you did try to make friends, and​/​or c) you're bitter about the idea of being social because you got picked on for being "weird" in high school, that's a different story. It's okay if you're not operating at 100 percent self-awareness at all times; no one is. Just check in on yourself occasionally and adjust course if needed. 

<q1>"I'm on the fence about working on my social skills. I just don't enjoy socializing and don't see how I'd get any personal benefit from improving at it."</q1>

If you truly don't get much out of socializing, then you should live your life in a way that reflects your personality. However, many people who express this view are younger. They think they don't like socializing because they haven't experienced how rewarding it can be. Simply put, they don't know what they're missing. They associate "conversation" with all the awkward or insulting interactions they've had, instead of associating it with interesting, affirming exchanges with good friends who get them. 
<t>If your social skills are less developed, you have a lower ability to "unlock" the fun in many situations. For example, attending a party is going to feel like a chore if you don't know how to mingle and participate in engaging conversations, and are uncomfortable with letting loose or dancing. Of course, if you don't get a lot out of parties even after you know how to navigate them, that's okay too. It's also okay if you're not that keen on getting good at socializing at parties to begin with. Not everyone has to like all the same activities or be a social butterfly. However, when you're inexperienced or gun-shy, it can cloud your sense of how appealing certain types of socializing can be. Once your interpersonal skills and confidence are higher you may find you enjoy some activities more than you used to.

<q1>"It's not socializing itself that I dislike. It's that I generally think other people suck."</q1>

Sometimes when a person says they "don't like people," it's just their semi-facetious way of stating, "I'm not super social by nature. I don't need a ton of friends. I'm selective about who I hang around. My personality is on the less conventional side, and I've come to realize most people don't have a lot to offer me." That's fine. Not everybody has to be mainstream and love everyone. 
<t>At other times "I just don't like people" is said in a much more wounded, hostile manner. As with believing you don't like being social, feeling that you don't like people may be a reasonable conclusion based on your life so far. Who wouldn't dislike people if all they've known is cruel classmates, unsympathetic parents, coworkers they have little in common with, and a difficult, nitpicky boss? 
<t>It's also easier to form a negative opinion of people when you're at a distance. If you spend a lot of time alone, and your only social interactions are fleeting and superficial, a lot of the information you receive about humanity is more abstract. You read articles about the latest bar-lowering hit TV show or trashy celebrity. When you look at life from that detached viewpoint, it's easy to be down on everyone else. Improved social skills let you have the positive firsthand experiences that reinforce how great people can be. 

<q1>"I'm the way I am now socially because I was picked on in the past. Why should I have to change? It's society in general and the type of people who bullied me who should change."</q1>

If you were picked on for perfectly acceptable differences like your interests, then I agree you shouldn't have to change those things. However, if being picked on caused you to develop social problems that are having an undeniable negative effect on your life, you probably do want to change by getting rid of them. 
<t>It's unjust that you experienced these adversities, but in the end they're still issues you need to deal with. You're only holding yourself back if you refuse to deal with them out of a sense that it's not fair. It's like if you were walking down the street and a stranger jumped out from behind a corner and shot you in the leg. Is it your fault that this happened? Not at all. Is it unfair? Certainly. Is whoever did it a horrible person? Without a doubt. But at the end of the day, you still have a gunshot wound in your thigh that you need to attend to. You can't get everyone in the world to change; you can only work on yourself.
