<smallcaps>Here are some books</smallcaps> that go more in-depth about some of the topics this book covers. These aren’t the author’s one-and-only recommendations, just good examples of books on the subject. Of course, in this day and age, you can also find a lot of solid information on the Internet, though it’s sometimes hard to find one comprehensive resource as opposed to a bunch of short, summary-level articles spread across several sites. This list doesn’t include any websites because they come and go relatively quickly, but if you do a search on a particular topic, it shouldn’t be hard to find some advice on it.
