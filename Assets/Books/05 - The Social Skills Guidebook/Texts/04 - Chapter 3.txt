<h2>Seeing the Effects of Shyness, Social Anxiety, Insecurity, and Discouragement</h2>


<smallcaps>If you're like many people</smallcaps> who want to improve their social situation, the biggest thing holding you back is your own mind. You may be quite socially capable and charming when you feel comfortable with someone, but in many situations, your shyness, anxiety, insecurities, and counter-productive thinking get in the way. 
<t>This chapter describes the four main confidence and comfort issues that interfere with people's ability to socialize: 

1.Shyness. 
2.Social anxiety. 
3.Insecurity. 
4.Pessimism and discouragement.

<h3>Shyness</h3>

Shyness is a multifaceted condition with many variations and nuances, but in short it's when you feel inhibited and uncomfortable in certain social situations because you're worried about how you'll come across to everyone. Just as other social difficulties can range from mild to severe, shyness also comes in degrees. If you're slightly shy, you may seem totally functional and even charming. Even though you may have some inner worries and insecurities, you can socialize in spite of them. Your shyness isn't a huge problem, but even if you're performing well outwardly, it's still draining to be constantly worrying and doubting yourself. If you're moderately shy, you'll be more hesitant and quiet than normal in social situations, but still be able to get by. If you're severely shy, you'll be totally withdrawn, if you get into many interactions at all. Less mild forms of shyness overlap with social anxiety, which will be covered in a second. 
<t>The richest aspect of shyness is the thinking patterns and beliefs that fuel it. Shy people think in ways that increase the supposed risks and stakes of socializing. They see other people as mean and judgmental. They see themselves as unappealing and less socially capable. They view interactions as life-or-death tests of their social skills and worthiness as individuals. Chapter 5 goes into more detail about these unhelpful thinking patterns. 
<t>People who suffer from shyness often second-guess the meaning behind other people's words. They may be hypersensitive to perceived signs of rejection or hostility ("She only sort of laughed at my joke. She must hate me." "He complimented my hat. He's probably messing with me somehow.") Sometimes they dwell on past social situations, sometimes years after the fact, and beat themselves up over the things they supposedly did wrong.

<b>Overall presentation</b>

Regardless of how shy you are, you're likely to experience some or all of the following effects: 

•Being hesitant, reserved, and untalkative.
•Coming across as meek, soft-spoken, and unsure of what you're saying.
•Acting uncomfortable (for example, fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, crossing your arms over your chest).
•Having trouble getting your words out or putting sentences together; stuttering.
•Coming across as unconfident and self-effacing.
•On occasion, being more outgoing and chatty than normal because of nerves or because that's how other people expect you to behave.
•On occasion, coming across as cold and aloof because you unintentionally act this way when you're feeling awkward, or because you're purposely trying to manage your discomfort by sending out "don't approach me" vibes.
•Reacting physically: blushing; trembling; muscle tension; sweating; clammy hands; dry mouth; tight, quiet voice; increased heart rate; stomach upset; increased need to urinate; feeling amped up and fidgety. 

<b>Circumstances that can bring on shyness</b>

You may feel shy in most social situations or only during particular ones. Situations in which people commonly feel shy include:

•Meeting new people.
•Having to work a room and mingle.
•Interacting with people you find intimidating and high-status (for example, asking a professor to reconsider a grade she gave you on a paper).
•Interacting with people whose opinion you really care about and whom you want to make a good impression on.
•Being put on the spot (for example, being handed a microphone out of the blue and asked to record a video message at a wedding).
•Being the center of attention or doing something that draws attention to yourself (for example, being called on in class, wearing flashy clothes, calling down a hall to get a friend's attention).
•Having to perform (for example, giving a speech or telling a story when everyone at the table is listening intently).
•Confronting someone or being assertive (for example, telling a friend you don't like it when they tease you constantly, telling a coworker you don't want to help them move on the weekend).
•During interactions where you may upset the other person (for example, turning down a request, asking someone not to do something annoying, asking a person to go out of their way for you).
•Talking on the phone or having to leave a voicemail. 

<b>Approaching social situations</b>

Shy people dread many common social settings or interactions because they aren't sure how to act or they aren't sure how they'll be received by others. See if any of these responses for handling social situations sound familiar:

•Completely avoiding social situations or interactions that make you feel shy (for example, not going to a party, crossing the street to avoid having to stop and chat with an acquaintance, sending an email when a phone call would be easier, not following up to hang out with someone you met the other day).
•Bailing out of social situations early (for example, making an excuse to end a conversation after a few minutes, leaving a pub because you feel so out of your element).
•Partially avoiding social situations or interactions (for example, being present in a group conversation but not saying anything).
•Being less likely to take social risks (for example, not asking someone to hang out, not approaching a stranger to start a conversation, holding back a mildly controversial opinion).

<b>Overall consequences</b>

Being shy does more than keep you home at night. It also causes these overarching problems:

•The self-doubt and inhibition inherent in shyness prevent you from showing your full personality. When you're in a conversation with people you feel uncomfortable around, you stand there silently, and no one sees what you're capable of. However, if the people were your long-time friends, you'd be making all kinds of hilarious jokes and witty observations. 
•It keeps you from going after what you want. 
•It simply doesn't feel good to be so hard on yourself or feel so ill-at-ease in certain situations.
•Your shy behavior may create a poor impression on other people. It's not that most people think horribly of shyness; it's just that if it comes down to being sure of yourself or being withdrawn, the former is going to come across better. 
•Making friends is difficult. You can still make friends when you're shy, but the process takes longer and you may have less control. You have to hope that you'll spend enough time with the other people for you to feel comfortable around them or that they'll give you a chance and make all the first moves. 

<t>Getting a handle on your shyness allows you to reverse the condition. You'll be more willing to show your personality and put yourself out there in social situations. You'll feel better about who you are. You'll feel comfortable instead of being a ball of nerves. On the whole, your interactions will be more effective. Reducing your shyness also frees you up to work on your social skills more effectively. You'll be able to socialize more often, during which time you can take more chances, push yourself harder, and make more mistakes you can learn from. 

<h3>Social anxiety</h3>

Social anxiety is when you feel nervous in social situations. It has a lot in common with shyness; it leads to similar outcomes, like avoidance and impaired social performance, and is often brought on by fears about how you'll come across to people. However, social anxiety and shyness don't always go hand in hand. It's possible to feel shy and inhibited at a party without feeling physically nervous. It's also possible, but less likely, to feel anxious in a social situation without having a ton of worries or insecurities (for example, even though you know everything will turn out fine, you're stressed about meeting your friend's friends just because it's a new situation and you're generally frazzled from problems at work). 
<t>With social anxiety, the nervousness can become its own problem. Mild anxiety isn't oodles of fun, but it's relatively easy to tolerate and push through. Physically it doesn't feel that different from excitement. You may feel a little amped up and jittery or have some minor sweating, blushing, or butterflies in the stomach. Moderate anxiety is another story. Besides your fear levels being higher, it can cause unpleasant bodily symptoms like nausea, trembling, dizziness, hot flashes, heart palpitations, and a need to use the bathroom. Severe anxiety​—​that is, a panic attack​—​is downright terrifying. You feel incredibly bad physically, you have an intense urge to escape, and you often think you're going to die or go crazy. 

<b>Acknowledging social fears</b>

If a social situation made you anxious, a completely understandable reaction would be to become scared of it and want to steer clear of it in the future. Stronger anxiety can also lead you to develop a second-order fear that your anxiety is obvious and noticeable, which in turn can cause you to fear being rejected; you may worry that everyone will be put off by your looking like a shaky wreck, or that you'll do something humiliating, like throw up or freak out in public. 
<t>As with shyness, social anxiety can crop up in most social situations or be specific to a particular one. These more specific fears may be the same as the ones a shy person has (for example, meeting new people). Socially anxious people can develop other types of specific fears. First, they may get nervous and self-conscious in day-to-day situations where they feel people are watching or evaluating them, such as eating in front of their friends, writing in view of others, working out at the gym, or, for men, using a urinal with other guys around. Second, they may develop a fear of situations where they're "trapped." In situations where people feel trapped, they worry that if they were to become really anxious, they'd draw attention to themselves and perhaps become a laughing-stock (for example, sitting in the middle seat of a crowded movie theater, getting a haircut, riding the subway).
<t>The problem is that this is all self-reinforcing. You develop a fear of fear. When you're worried about getting anxious, you're almost guaranteed to bring on the very nervousness you want to avoid. It's one more obstacle to improving socially. If you go to a party, you're so preoccupied with managing your nerves that trying to connect with anyone gets pushed to the back burner. 

<b>Overcoming avoidance</b>

It's no picnic when your nerves screw up your conversation in the moment, so you may choose to avoid interactions that may be difficult or unpleasant for you. However, over the long run, the avoidance that anxiety encourages is more damaging. Avoiding something that scares you prevents you from feeling bad in the short term, but often runs counter to your long-term interests. Anxiety is manageable if you're afraid of some obscure scenario, but it's another story if you feel nervous about day-to-day social situations that you want to be involved in. A key to handling anxiety is to break the avoidance habit. 
<t>Avoiding something you fear plays into a vicious cycle, which strengthens your anxiety. Whenever you avoid a situation, the relief you feel reinforces the behavior and cements the idea that you dodged something truly dangerous. Avoidance can make you miss out on important parts of life when you try to prevent yourself from ever feeling uncomfortable. You can end up rearranging your days into a lonely, sterile rut. 
<t>It's one thing to feel blatantly nervous and cancel on a dinner party or decide against trying to start a conversation with a classmate. However, anxiety can be a lot more subtle when it comes to avoiding social situations. People sometimes have a hard time admitting that they're not doing something because it makes them uneasy, and anxiety is great at providing reasonable-sounding excuses and rationalizations. Anxiety can make you think you truly aren't interested in an activity when the situation really just scares you. You can be about to leave for a get-together when you start thinking, "You know what? I really should study tonight instead." Subtle anxiety can also appear as procrastination. You really want to join that running club, but you've been putting it off for the past six months because it's never the perfect time. 
<t><i>Safety behaviors</i> allow you to partially avoid a situation. These behaviors shelter you from the full brunt of an anxiety-provoking situation. For example, if you feel off-balance at parties, you may drink a lot to dull your nerves and have a ready-made excuse for any gaffes you make. Safety behaviors can also be more understated. If you're mildly anxious in social situations, you may be able to have conversations, but only when you stick to neutral topics, keep the focus on the other person, and don't reveal any deeper personal information about yourself. If you have trouble with specific symptoms like blushing or nausea, you may wear your hair in a way that covers more of your face or always carry some stomach-soothing medication around "just in case."

<b>Social Anxiety Disorder</b>

Shyness is a fairly common, if inconvenient trait. Everyone feels socially anxious at times. However, if you experience anxiety in social situations often or intensely enough that it interferes with your life, a professional could decide a diagnosis of Social Anxiety Disorder​/​Social Phobia is appropriate. Here are the criteria for it from the latest edition of the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i>:

<h4>DSM-5 Criteria for Social Anxiety Disorder</h4>

A.Marked fear or anxiety about one or more social situations in which the individual is exposed to possible scrutiny by others. Examples include social interactions (for example, having a conversation, meeting unfamiliar people), being observed (for example, eating or drinking), and performing in front of others (for example, giving a speech). 
B.The individual fears that he or she will act in a way or show anxiety symptoms that will be negatively evaluated (that is, will be humiliating and embarrassing; will lead to rejection or offend others). 
C.The social situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety. 
D.The social situations are avoided or endured with intense fear or anxiety. 
E.The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual threat posed by the social situation and to the sociocultural context. 
F.The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for 6 months or more. 
G.The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. 
H.The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (for example, a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition. 
I.The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder, such as panic disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, or autism spectrum disorder. 
J.If another medical condition (for example, Parkinson's disease, obesity, disfigurement from burns or injury) is present, the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is clearly unrelated or is excessive.

<t>To be diagnosed with Social Anxiety Disorder, your nervousness in social situations has to be at least moderate. There are degrees of severity within the condition. Someone with a mild version of it may feel quite uncomfortable in social situations, but is still able to be functional. In severe cases, people never leave their house, only socialize with family, and panic if they have to speak to anyone else. 
<t>If you suspect you have Social Anxiety Disorder, make an appointment to see a professional and get their opinion on what steps to take next. 

<h3>Insecurity</h3>

Insecurity boils down to having a low opinion of your own value (particularly in social situations), assuming other people won't like you, and believing your flaws will keep you from meeting your goals. Like anxiety, insecurity is often a component of shyness, but it can exist on its own. You could go to a social function and be outgoing and calm, while still having thoughts like, "I'm too lame to be hanging out with this crowd," "Everyone probably thinks I'm annoying," or "He gave me his number and said we should hang out, but if I call, he'll probably think I'm needy." 
<t>Insecurity doesn't rear its ugly head only before a social interaction. You may experience some of the following thoughts during a conversation:

•"I'm probably screwing up." 
•"They think I'm annoying." 
•"They'll only like me if I'm really impressive." 
•"They'll only like me if I hide who I really am." 
•"He glanced away for a split second after I made that joke. He probably thinks I'm corny and trying too hard." 
•"She's talking to me now, but it's probably just out of politeness. She'd never want to hang out later." 

<t>When you're facing the opportunity to pursue a friendship, these thoughts may run through your mind, causing you to second-guess whether you should reach out to the other person:

•"They probably don't want to hang out again." 
•"If we meet and grab a coffee, they'll realize how awkward I really am. No point in bothering." 

<t>Even after you've established relationships, you may feel insecure about your value to the other person:

•"My friends probably don't really like me. They're still hanging out with me only out of inertia or pity." 
•"She didn't return my text right away. She hates me." 

<b>Signs of insecurity</b>

Sometimes people who are insecure show no signs of it. Some insecure people have it together on the outside, and no one would ever guess that they question their value to themselves and others. But all too often, people who are insecure subtly convey that feeling to those they're talking to. Examples include:

•Coming across as shy, unconfident, and fearful about saying the wrong thing.
•Trying too hard to please people and do whatever it takes to get their approval.
•Bragging and trying too hard to impress people; acting overly outgoing and self-assured to compensate for a lack of confidence; putting others down so you'll feel better about yourself in comparison.
•Acting needy and clingy with friends (for example, contacting them constantly or always casually mentioning how much they mean to you and how devastated you'd be if they stopped hanging out with you).
•Trying too hard to control your friends' behavior and force them to be considerate toward you (for example, "I invited you to my birthday dinner, and you didn't let me know you were coming until a week before it was happening. You should have let me know right away!").
•Overreacting to possible signs of rejection, either by giving up entirely, showing needy behavior (sending a bunch of increasingly frantic "u there?" texts if they don't reply to you instantly), or being too quick to stand up for yourself and set them straight over minor issues ("You were half an hour late to my party. You have no respect for me! Don't let it happen again").

<h3>Discouragement and pessimism</h3>

Feeling discouraged or pessimistic is an issue that is different from the three above, but often goes hand in hand with them. The methods for addressing it are the same as well. A history of poor social outcomes can lead to pessimism and discouragement about meeting your goals to improve your social situation. Feeling discouraged can then cause you to develop a number of counter-productive mind-sets that can hinder you even further. It can also lead to self-sabotaging behavior where you don't try because you "know" you'll fail anyway. Here are some typical discouraging thoughts:

•"I'm too unlikable. There's no point in trying anymore." 
•"I could go to that party, but it won't get me anywhere, so I'll take a pass." 
•"They'll probably reject me, so I won't bother talking to them." 
•"They seem bored by me. I'll bow out of the conversation now to save us both time." 
•"He just gave me his number and said we should grab a beer sometime. It never works out when I follow up with someone, so I won't bother." 
•"Maybe other awkward people can improve, but my set of issues is too much to overcome." 

<t>The four related problems of shyness, social anxiety, insecurity, and discouragement need to be tackled directly. You should do some work on them before working on conversation or social life issues you want to fix. If you're shy and insecure around people, you can indirectly become more confident by developing your conversation and friend-making skills (assuming they're not already fine and your shyness just blocks them from coming out). One warning though: If you attempt to practice your social skills but haven't taken steps to address the counter-productive thinking at the core of your shyness and anxiety, you may end up worse off. You'll put yourself in social situations but still see them as dangerous and high-stakes; if something goes wrong, you may come to inaccurate, disheartening conclusions about yourself and your hopes of improving. You don't have to get your thinking to a flawless place before you start working on your people skills, but your thoughts should be at a level where they won't completely sabotage you either.
