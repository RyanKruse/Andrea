<h2>Starting One-on-One Conversations</h2>


<smallcaps>This is the first of several chapters</smallcaps> on how to navigate the stages of a typical conversation. Of course, not every conversation will go through the same progression like clockwork, but thinking in terms of stages helps you know what's likely to come next. 
<t>The first stage of a conversation is obviously to start it. Beginning conversations, especially with someone they don't know, makes many people nervous. They worry that they'll say the wrong thing and get rejected, or that they won't be able to think of anything to talk about and the interaction will stall soon after it begins. When you're comfortable initiating interactions and handling their first few minutes, a lot more options open up to you.

<h3>The two substages to starting conversations</h3>

The beginnings of conversations have two parts, which often flow into each other.
<t>The first is for one person to say something to the other to initiate the interaction. This could be as simple as a "hey." Sometimes the first step is taken care of for you: The other person approaches you, you're introduced to each other, or your circumstances force you to start talking. If none of those things happen, you'll have to start the conversation yourself if you want to chat with someone. An opening line may do nothing more than get the other person's attention and begin the interaction, so you'll need to follow up the opening with something else (introducing yourself is one example). Other openers can potentially lead to a full conversation (for example, going up to someone wearing a T-shirt of your favorite band and asking how they liked the latest album).
<t>The second substage is navigating the conversation's first few, sometimes uncertain, minutes. When you're first talking to someone, you often don't know much about them or what you could talk about with each other. Although at this point the usual conversation goals (like learning about the other person and showing you're a friendly, interested person) come into play, your main priority is to find a topic you both have an easy, enjoyable time discussing and settle into a comfortable groove. After that, you may continue to talk for hours about any number of issues, or you may each have to run after five minutes, but still leave the conversation feeling you had a nice chat. 
<t>Again, this part will sometimes feel simple and you'll start gabbing about a mutually interesting subject right away. Your conversation starter may lead to an area you and the other person have in common. Or after initiating the conversation with another opening line, the first thing you think to ask about after that hits the mark. It's also possible someone else will introduce you to each other and set you up (for example, "This is Alison. She's studying to be a pharmacist too"). If a good topic doesn't fall into your lap, you'll have to look for one, and you may hit a dead end or two before finding something that works. 

<b>Things to keep in mind about initiating a conversation</b>

Technically, initiating a conversation is simple. As long as it's not rude or totally out of left field, the exact opening line you use isn't that important. How the other person is likely to respond to you and how well the ensuing interaction goes will depend more on factors like whether the person you're talking to is in the mood to chat, what their initial impression of you is, how compatible the two of you are, and how good each person's conversation skills are. 
<t>However, your nerves may mislead you into seeing the task as more tricky and complicated than it is. Emotional reasoning may kick in and cause you to think, "This feels hard, therefore it must actually be difficult and require a lot of strategizing to find the perfect opener." If you're worried about getting rejected or offending someone, you may also hold out hope for a nonexistent magic line that will guarantee you won't get a bad response. 

<b>Things to keep in mind about getting through the first few minutes of conversation</b>

There are good and bad sides to the first few minutes of an interaction. In the Good column is the fact that they're fairly predictable. It's also pretty easy to practice them. If you go to a big party or networking event, it wouldn't be unusual to chat with a dozen or more people over the evening. On the downside, if you're going to have trouble in a conversation, it's likely going to be in those first couple of minutes. There are two reasons for this: First, if someone doesn't feel like speaking to you or you don't have much to say to each other, that's going to become clear quickly. The other person won't give you much to work with, or you'll both struggle to find something to talk about. Remember, there's no way to ensure every interaction you have will go well. Second, you're usually feeling at your most nervous and on the spot when you're first talking to someone, and anxiety can cause you or your conversation partner to stall. If you can get past that point, the rest of the conversation is usually easier.
<t>It's great when you find an interesting subject to talk about right away, but it's not at all unusual for a conversation to be a little stilted in its opening minutes. That's no reason to panic. This awkwardness isn't a sign that the interaction won't be enjoyable or that you have horrible people skills. It just means that each person hasn't found their footing yet. In a few minutes, everyone may be feeling more comfortable and have found something fun to talk about. 
<t>Sometimes a conversation you start may peter out soon after it begins. Knowing this takes some of the pressure away. Every time you talk to someone, realize that they may be preoccupied, have nothing in common with you, or be too shy to think of anything to say. Also accept that sometimes you just won't be on your game and able to do your part to keep the conversation moving. Have a plan for gracefully leaving a conversation that isn't going anywhere. Rather than panicking and blaming yourself, keep your cool and move on. (Chapter 13 covers how to end conversations.)

<h3>General guidelines for starting conversations</h3>

The appropriate ways to initiate a conversation vary depending on the situation you're in. If you're at a friend's party, it's expected that people will talk to each other, and most of the guests are there to do just that. It's fine to start conversations in a more forward, familiar, casual way where you act as if you're already on good terms with everyone. In more formal settings, like a career networking event, you should be a little more reserved and mannered. Still be friendly, but don't be overly casual or chummy right off the bat. 
<t>Talking to strangers in public places during the day is on the other end of the spectrum. Some people are open to talking, but others are going about their day and have other priorities. Read their body language for clues about how open they may be to interacting with you (see Chapter 18). If they seem really preoccupied and closed off, it may be better to leave them alone. You need to respect that they may initially be wary and not know what you want from them or not be in the mood to talk. You may need to get their attention with a smile or an "excuse me" first. Still be friendly, but speak with them in a more pulled-back, noncommittal way to give them the sense that you'll back off if they don't want to chat. 
<t>Know your city and country's attitude about what's considered acceptable too. In some areas, people are constantly, cheerfully talking to each other in grocery store lines, while in other places, the culture is "Don't intrude on anyone's space." If your culture is less talkative, it doesn't mean you'll never be able to speak to anyone you don't know. If you try, you just need to be extra respectful and realize you won't always get a warm response. 
<t>Public places where people go specifically to socialize, like nightclubs, fall in between. You have implicit permission to try to strike up a conversation with people you don't know, and you can often be more casual; however, you also have to respect that not everyone goes to those places looking to chat with a bunch of strangers. If they don't seem like they want to talk and would rather stick with the friends they came with, then move on.

<h3>Examples of types of conversation openers and early things to talk about</h3>

The following pages list several ways to initiate a one-on-one conversation and to try to find a good topic during its first few minutes. The two are together because many lines can pull double duty. Always have at least a few lines or topics ready to go. If you use one but the other person doesn't give you a response you can work with, be ready to try another. 
<t>Examples of many types of lines follow, but that's mainly to show you have lots of options. Don't feel you have to memorize every one. When you're in a situation where you want to talk to someone, go with one of the first lines that pop into your head because they could all work equally well. If you want to prepare ahead of time, settle on around half a dozen conversation starters that you'd feel comfortable using. In general, as you get better at thinking on your feet, you'll feel more comfortable using whatever type of conversation starter you want. Even if the other person doesn't answer in an ideal way, you know you can follow up and maybe recover the interaction.

<b>Openers that will begin a conversation, but have to be followed up with something else</b>

The only time these openers won't need to be followed up on is if the other person replies with a comment that naturally leads to a conversation. You can't count on that though, and should have another opener ready to use. 

<i>Introduce yourself</i>

Try something simple like, "Hey, I'm Stephen." With new people, you don't always have to introduce yourself to begin speaking to them. You could start the interaction another way, and if all goes well, after a while it will feel natural to say, "Oh, I'm so-and-so, by the way. What's your name?"

<i>Ask them a simple question about the situation you're in</i>

For example, at a party you could ask them if they know the name of the song that's playing or if they can tell you what kind of sauce is being served with the hors d'oeuvres. Of all the ways to start a conversation, this is the one where people use white lies the most. They aren't interested in the answer and are just using the question as a pretense to talk. Some people think they can only use this type of conversation starter because it seems more spontaneous and natural. It also doesn't put them at risk of rejection as much because they have the face-saving explanation that they just wanted a question answered. There's no need to box yourself in by always needing a believable excuse to speak to someone. When you're chatting with people for friendly reasons, it's perfectly fine to start a conversation more directly.

<i>Ask them to do something simple for you</i> 

For example, you could ask if they could save your chair while you get up for a second, if they have a lighter, or if they want to exchange email addresses so you can send each other your notes if one of you misses a class. 

<i>Say "Hello" or "Hey" or "What's up?" or "How's it going?"</i>

This is a common way to get a conversation rolling, and it often does the job, but it can be confusing and cause the interaction to stall. The other person may think you're only greeting them, reply with something like, "Hey, I'm good, thanks," and move on. Using a "What's up?"-type opener works better in the following circumstances:

•You have some follow-up questions or statements prepared if the other person doesn't reply with anything substantial. 
•The person looks friendly and like they want to talk to you. You sense that if you begin with "Hey" or "What's up?" they'll give you a more detailed response. 
•Neither of you is rushing somewhere else, and it's clear that you can both stick around and talk to each other. For example, if you catch a coworker as they're walking past you in the hall, they may take your "Hey, what's up?" simply as a greeting. However, if they're sitting at a table in the break room and you join them and say, "What's up?", that sends the message that you want to have an actual conversation. 

<b>Lines that can be used to initiate a conversation or a few minutes in to try to keep it going</b>

Some lines serve double duty. You can use them to initiate a conversation, or you can use them to keep a conversation going when it stalls or you finish talking about a topic.

<i>Ask questions that are relevant to the setting</i>

You and others in a social setting generally have something in common; otherwise you wouldn't be at the same place at the same time. With that in mind, ask an opening question that is built in to your common situation. This lets you exchange basic background information about each other or find out more about the setting you're in. Here are some examples:

•<b>At a party:</b> "How do you know everyone else here?" 
•<b>At a gaming club:</b> "What games are you playing these days?", "How long have you been playing?" 
•<b>Upon joining a recreational sports team:</b> "How long have you been on the team?", "Do you play any other sports?" 
•<b>At a new class:</b> "Is this course part of your major, or just an elective?", "I missed the first class. Did the prof hand out a course outline?" 
•<b>At a meet-up:</b> "Is this your first time at one of these events?" 
•<b>On your first day on the job:</b> "How long have you been working here?", "What's it like working here?" 
•<b>While traveling:</b> "How long have you been here? What cities were you visiting before?" 
•<b>At a dance club:</b> "Do you know if this place is normally good on this night?" 

<i>Comment on your shared situation</i>

•"Man, there are a ton of customers in here today." 
•"Today's class was pretty slow, huh?" 

<i>Make a statement about the other person or give them a compliment</i>

•"You seem like you're really into this song." 
•"I like your hat. Where did you get it?" 
•(To the host of a party) "Wow, you've got a cool movie collection." 

<b>Lines that are more appropriate once you've already begun talking to someone</b>

These can be used as an opening line, but will seem too out of the blue unless you already know the person or you're in a context, like a small, informal house party, where it's okay to approach people in a familiar way. 

<i>Ask typical getting-to-know-you questions</i>

•"What kind of hobbies do you do in your spare time?" 
•"Have you done anything really fun recently?" 
•"What do you do for work?" 
•"What are you taking in school?" 
•"What do you think of (a popular interest you hope they share or a news story everyone is talking about)?" 
•"Have you been able to travel this summer​/​winter?" 
•"Are you from here?" If they reply no, ask, "How long have you lived in the area?" 
•"Do you have any kids?" If they say yes, ask follow-up questions. "How old are they? How many? Girls or boys?" 
•"How do you know Martin?" or "You went to the same school as Martin. Do you know Carmen and Justin?" 

<i>Ask a question or make a statement about an interesting outside topic</i>

Question examples:

•"Have you seen (popular new movie)? What did you think of it?" 
•"Did you read that article yesterday about…? 

Statement examples:

•"I'm thinking of seeing (popular new movie). I saw the trailer for it, and it looks awesome…" 
•"I read a really interesting article the other day. It was saying that…" 

<i>Make a statement about yourself</i>

•"I'm so happy right now. I just handed in my last paper for this semester." 
•"So I think I finally found a job teaching English in the Japanese city I want to visit." 

<i>If you already know the person, ask for an update about something that's been happening in their life</i>

•"So how was your weekend out of town?" 
•"How's your daughter doing? Has she gotten over her cold yet?" 

<b>Thoughts on asking more creative hypothetical questions</b>

Some advice on starting conversations says you should avoid any standard lines and ask only unique, engaging questions. This suggestion is overrated. Sometimes it can work, but in your day-to-day life when you're talking to friends, coworkers, classmates, or friendly strangers at a party, saying more typical stuff is okay. Many people like a bit of predictability at the start of their conversations and may be caught off guard and draw a blank if you ask them something like, "If you could turn into any animal, what would you be?" Less is more when it comes to being creative in your conversations. The odd unique question can be fun, but it comes off as a bit random and gimmicky if you're constantly asking strangers at a party things like, "If there were no laws for a day, what would you do?" 

<b>How to respond if someone tries to start a conversation with you</b>

If someone else has initiated an interaction and you're open to speaking to them, all you need to do is seem friendly and approachable. Use open, cheerful body language to show you're happy to talk (see Chapter 19). Give a good, full response to whatever their opening question or statement is. Even if it's something you've heard a lot and are a bit bored to talk about, still give a proper, amiable reply. Possibly end your reply by asking a question of your own.

<h3>Be willing to take the lead to help get a new conversation off the ground</h3>

Conversations sometimes die right away because each person is unsure how to act, doesn't want to seem too selfish or pushy, and is waiting for the other to direct where the exchange goes. If you're shy, directing the conversation may not be something you'll be comfortable with initially, but taking the lead can come with practice and experience. Here's how you can try to direct the exchange:

•Be the first to ask a getting-to-know-you question and pick the one you think will work best (for example, choosing to ask about their hobbies because you have a feeling you'll have some in common and they'll feel comfortable with that subject). 
•Politely change the subject if you're on a topic that doesn't seem to be going anywhere. 
•Say something to kick-start the exchange if it's petering out. For example, ask about their interests if talking about your jobs didn't lead anywhere. 
•Ask general questions and make broad statements that take the discussion in that ever-important mutually interesting direction. (For example, you ask someone about their summer, and they mention working a part-time job, attending a wedding, and visiting Europe. You have a lot to say about traveling, so you choose to ask them about their trip or mention your trip to Spain.) It's selfish to always steer conversations to only what you want to talk about, but it's okay to do this occasionally, especially if it helps get or keep an interaction going. 
•Do most of the talking until the other person gets more comfortable (again, this is a more advanced skill). For example, you ask them about their job, they don't say much, and you get a sense they're feeling on the spot. Rather than ask them more questions, you bring up your own job and tell a quick, funny story about something that happened to you at work. That gives them time to collect themselves.
