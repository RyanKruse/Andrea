<h2>Trouble-Shooting the Process of Making Friends</h2>


<smallcaps>Aside from being unsure</smallcaps> of how to handle specific situations like being new in a city and not knowing anyone, other mental and practical issues can hinder people from making friends: having various worries about trying to make friends; experiencing life circumstances, like a lack of money, that interfere with your social life; getting poor reactions to your friendly overtures; and feeling iffy about many of the potential friends you meet. This chapter gives suggestions for handling all of them. 

<h3>Common worries people have about making friends</h3>

Chapter 24 covered two common concerns that arise when trying to make new friends: feeling desperate when pursuing friendships and believing you have to hide your loneliness. Here are some other ones. As with any insecurities, being aware of and challenging the counter-productive thoughts beneath them can help, but in the end, it may take several positive firsthand experiences to finally get rid of them.

<q1>"I don't feel desperate, but I'm worried about coming across as desperate and putting people off."</q1>

<b>Alternative:</b> No one will see you as desperate if you do typical friendly things like starting conversations with people you don't know, trying to chat with acquaintances, inviting someone out, or texting friends to catch up. You have to act blatantly desperate to be seen that way. Desperate acts can include inviting people out after they've already turned you down seven times; texting someone way more frequently than they text you; or telling them how much their friendship means to you after knowing them only a few days. 

<q1>"It feels weird to ask around to see what people's weekend plans are."</q1>

<b>Alternative:</b> Asking around about others' weekend plans is completely normal behavior. If you're already close friends with someone, you have an unspoken okay to ask them what they're up to or try to join a group outing they're planning to attend. It's two equals sharing information and figuring out something to do together. (Once more, it's emotional reasoning to believe that because you <i>feel</i> desperate about doing something that it <i>is</i> desperate. See Chapter 5 for more details about emotional reasoning.)

<q1>"If I ask around to see what people's plans are, I'll reveal I have nothing going on."</q1>

<b>Alternative:</b> There's nothing weird or rare about not having plans for later in the week. Being open about not having plans is something people do all the time, and they aren't embarrassed about it. Their thought process is, "Oh, it's Friday, and I didn't think to organize anything yet. I'd better see what my friends are up to."

<q1>"Asking around to see what your social circle's plans are is fine if they're your friends. But I want to hang out with some people I don't know that well. It'd be inappropriate to ask them what they're up to."</q1>

<b>Alternative:</b> That may seem inappropriate, but you have two perfectly acceptable options: 1) Take a calculated social risk and ask these acquaintances what their plans are, even though it might not work out perfectly. Be sure to ask in a casual, low-pressure way; 2) Play it safe and get to know them a little better first, and then take a stab at making plans.

<q1>"Asking someone to hang out makes me feel like I'm ‘one down'."</q1>

<b>Alternative:</b> If you invite someone out, it doesn't automatically mean you're lower on the social totem pole; it just means you have something fun in mind that you want to do and are trying to round up some people to do it with. More popular people try to organize plans too. They don't sit back and wait for everyone to come to them. 

<q1>"I'm really not sure if I know the other person well enough to invite them to hang out."</q1>

<b>Alternative:</b> Use your judgment. If you think you may not have spoken to someone enough for the invitation to be justified, maybe get to know them a little more first. On the other hand, you can sometimes become friends with people faster than you think you can, and inviting them out can be one way to do that. Also, think about whether you truly don't know them that well. That worry may just be your nervousness talking. 

<q1>"What if people say no when I invite them out? That means they hate me, right? I don't think I could handle it."</q1>

<b>Alternative:</b> If you invite people out, you will get turned down some of the time. If you're arranging a larger activity, it's almost a given that some people won't be able to come. It's often not personal. People may turn down a plan because:

•They're not up for the activity you suggested.
•They just don't feel like going out and want to have a quiet night in.
•They've already made plans with other people, but would have been up for it otherwise. 
•They have other non-social things they have to do.
•The logistics of the event are inconvenient (for example, they'd have to take the bus for an hour to get there).
•Money is tight, and they can't afford to attend. 
•They don't know anyone else who's going and aren't in the mood to try to get to know a bunch of new people. 
•They like your company, but not in that situation (for example, they like talking to you one-on-one over coffee but not going to bars with you).
•They have their own insecurities (for example, they're older than you and your friends and worry about seeming lame by tagging along with a younger crowd). 

<t>Even if they turn you down because they don't think the two of you are compatible, everyone experiences that kind of rejection, and it's something you can learn to manage.

<q1>"What if I arrange something and only a few people show up? I'll look bad, and the event will be awkward with so few guests."</q1>

<b>Alternative:</b> There's no law that says all of your events have to be big or get a huge turnout. Getting a lot of people to come out is often as much about offering an enticing activity and being lucky enough to have everyone's schedules line up as it is about how popular you are. You'll often have an idea of what the attendance will be ahead of time, so you can always postpone if no one bites when you first suggest the plan. If you don't initially frame the event as big, it doesn't look weird if not many people show up. If the event does end up being smaller, it can still be fun, just in a different way than a giant get-together. You can always improvise too; for example, "This party is pretty quiet. Let's just go out instead."

<q1>"What if I arrange something and no one shows up? I definitely couldn't handle that."</q1>

<b>Alternative:</b> It's rare to be left waiting for people who will never arrive. More commonly you'll get a bunch of last-minute cancellations. Many people have had the odd plan fizzle out like this. It doesn't mean you're a failure for all time, just that you should try again, and maybe change up your approach by suggesting something that's more convenient or appealing to your invited guests. Most big plans end up with one or two flake-outs, and everyone cancelling at once may just be an unfortunate coincidence. However, if it seems like part of a larger pattern of your friends not respecting your time, you'll need to talk to them. 

<q1>"What if things are awkward once the event is under way?"</q1>

<b>Alternative:</b> Being worried about uncomfortable moments is mostly run-of-the-mill anticipatory anxiety, and everything will likely go fine, especially if you've previously had good interactions with everyone. If things are awkward, it doesn't mean you're forever hopeless; you may not be meant to be friends with those particular people, or you may need some more practice with your conversation skills. 

<q1>"I feel like I'm always the one arranging things with my friends. They never invite me out. They must not like me."</q1>

<b>Alternative:</b> It's hard to read any one person or group's mind, but sometimes friends never show initiative because they're a bit lazy and disorganized about making plans; they're really busy; they would suggest something, but you always ask first; or they've come to expect you to be the organizer.

<q1>"I feel discouraged. I tried to get some people to go out to a bar, but hardly anyone came. Then Maria proposed the exact same thing a few weeks later, and twenty people fell all over themselves to be there."</q1>

<b>Alternative:</b> Worry about your own social life, and don't tie yourself in knots comparing your plan-making success to other people's. Some people will be more popular than you. It is what it is. What's important is that you have a social circle that makes you happy, even if you have to work at it a little more at the moment. Don't fall into black-and-white thinking where you believe if you're not the absolute best, you must be completely worthless. 

<h3>"My life circumstances are interfering with my social life"</h3>

Many life situations, like living in a dull, isolated village, can get in the way of your making friends. These unhelpful circumstances undeniably make things harder. However, you probably can do at least a little better than you are now, and you shouldn't be too quick to throw in the towel or turn your circumstances into an excuse. Overall, when faced with one of these barriers, you have three long-term choices:

1.You can try to adapt to your situation and get more out of it. 
2.You can wait for things to shift in your favor. 
3.You can escape entirely. 

<t>If you're not an adult yet, your freedom and choices are limited, and you have to bide your time until more options open up to you. Even if you're stuck in a less-than-ideal situation, you can still use your time to lay the groundwork for the future (for example, saving money for a car, or honing your social skills for university while you're stuck at home during high school). Here are some suggestions for particular situations:

<b>Living in a small, boring town</b>

•Make a real effort to find everything going on in your community, as well as getting to know the locals whom you have the most in common with. 
•If possible, get a car and see what's available in neighboring towns or cities. 
•If you really feel bored and constrained and like there's no one worth knowing where you live, the only real option is to move. That may not be a possibility now, but it could be down the road if you save up enough money to leave or arrange to attend university or take a job in a far-off city. 

<b>Living far away from everyone</b>

•If you've decided that your far-flung location is social kryptonite, try having people over. They may not be as reluctant to visit as you think. 
•Hang out at the homes of friends who do live nearby. They may understand you live far away and not care that they can't go to your place. Don't feel you must have people over to your home in order to have a life. 
•Hang out with people in spots other than someone's house. The older you get, the more possibilities open up to do things outside of going over to a buddy's place after school. 
•Be around people in organized settings such as lessons, clubs, or team sports. 
•Try making some friends with the people in your area. Your social circle doesn't have to include only people from your school. Check out what's going on in your part of town. 
•Once you're of legal drinking age, living far from all the bars and clubs can mess up a night because you may need to cut it short to catch the bus or train home. You can figure out ways around this: Consider arranging to stay at a mate's place, taking a cab home, or trying to get your buddies to come to a more local bar and then crash on your couch. 

<b>Living at home</b>

•Unless there's something obvious getting in the way, like your parents have forbidden you from having guests over, there's no reason to assume you can't invite people to your place. 
•If hanging out at home isn't an option, spend time with friends in any number of other spots. 
•If you're in your mid-twenties or older, don't assume that living at home automatically carries a stigma. Living with your parents is normal in many cultures, and even in ones where grown children are expected to move out, there's an increasing understanding that not everyone can afford to do so right away. 

<b>Living in a run-down apartment or neighborhood you're embarrassed about</b>

•Again, if doing things at your own place isn't feasible, hang out with people elsewhere. 
•Don't be too quick to assume this is a mark against you. Most adults understand that not everyone can afford luxury accommodations and may have to live in a cheaper area to save money. 
•Do whatever is realistically possible to spruce up your home. 

<b>Not having a car or not being able to drive in an area where you need a vehicle to get around</b>

•Don't feel you must have a car to have friends. If you're an otherwise solid person, no one's going to judge you because you can't pick them up or drive somewhere. 
•Get rides with other people (be sure to pitch in for gas on longer trips), take public transit when you can, or take cabs. Arrange to meet people at your destination instead of picking them up. 
•In the long term, prioritize learning to drive and getting your hands on a vehicle. 

<b>Not having a lot of money for hanging out with friends</b>

•Realize many people, especially when they're young, don't have a ton of spare cash but still manage to have a decent social life. 
•Hang out at friends' places as much as you can, rather than going out all the time. 
•Do free activities like going for a hike or attending a street festival. 
•Do inexpensive activities like seeing a movie, having coffee, or visiting a local attraction on a day of the week when admission is lower. 
•Eat at cheaper restaurants. 
•If you're into drinking, drink at home before going out, rather than paying inflated bar prices (of course, don't put your health at risk and drink too much too quickly just to save a few bucks). 
•Go to bars with cheap or no cover. Some venues don't charge a cover if you get there early enough. Learn which bars in your city have cheap drink specials on various nights of the week. 
•If it's feasible, get a part-time job. You don't even need to work that many hours a week if you're only doing it for a bit of spending money. 

<b>Being underage so you can't get into bars, especially when your friends are old enough</b>

•Look for all-ages events and venues. 
•Try to go to more house parties with your friends instead of going to bars. 
•Just wait to turn the legal age. Everyone is too young at one point. 

<b>Being really busy</b>

•Purposely make time for your social life rather than thinking of it as something you may get to if everything else is out of the way. 
•Learn to work or study more efficiently so you can free up some time to go out. 
•Spend your social time efficiently: See your friends in shorter, higher-quality bursts; catch up with several people at once; or organize get-togethers that fit between things you already had to do. 
•If your hectic schedule is leaving you too tired to socialize, recover your energy with well-timed naps or hits of caffeine. 

<h3>"People just don't seem interested in being friends with me, and I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong"</h3>

Chapter 9 covered the issue of others not reacting well when you try to speak with them. This trouble area is similar, but the impasse comes a bit later. People respond well enough that you can talk to them for a while, maybe even on a regular basis, but they don't seem interested in becoming closer friends. They may not take you up on your invitations, or they may not invite you out themselves. They may chat with you if they run into you somewhere, but the relationship never goes beyond that. Here are some possibilities that may help you suss out where you're going wrong:

<b>Try making friends in a better way</b>

•Talk to people first, instead of expecting them to come to you. 
•Go beyond greeting people and exchanging some quick pleasantries; don't expect them to take over from there. 
•Have longer conversations with people and invite them out, instead of expecting them to invite you out. 
•Don't think you just have to perform certain social "moves," like taking an interest in people, and then everyone will instantly want to be friends with you. 
•Accept people's invitations. If people have invited you out a few times, but you never accepted, they've likely given up on you. 
•Get better at making plans. Instead of, say, inviting people out at the last second to events that aren't really their style, consider their interests and ask them to do something a few days in advance. 
•Keep trying. Don't be too quick to give up after the first setback ("She said she was too busy to get together on Friday. She must hate me. No point in trying again"). 

<b>The other people aren't interested in being friends with you</b>

Something many lonely people need to do is to take more initiative to actively build a social circle for themselves. That advice only goes so far, though. Just because you put effort into trying to be friends with people doesn't mean it's always going to work out. Here are a few reasons your friendship prospects may not be keen on being buddies:

•You're not the ideal type of friend for the type of people you usually approach. Some people mainly try to befriend stereotypically popular or high-status types, even though they have little in common with them. 
•You're making an interaction mistake of some sort that doesn't put people off immediately, but makes them unsure about getting to know you better. 
•You don't seem to enjoy the same activities your potential friends enjoy. 
•Someone hung out with you a few times, but eventually decided the two of you aren't compatible. 
•The people you're pursuing are your coworkers or classmates, and they aren't interested in being friends with anyone they meet at work or school. They just want to put in their time and leave. 

<t>Again, the best way to get to the bottom of the issue is to get in-person feedback on how you're coming across. 

<h3>"I don't have trouble meeting people, but I don't like them"</h3>

Some lonely people are overly picky. It's fine to screen out jerks or anyone you have nothing in common with. Choosiness is a problem, though, if you're meeting people whom you get along with pretty well, but you're always left with a feeling of, "Meh, I don't know. I think I could do better." Studies have shown that lonely people tend to be more negative about others in general. Although people with this problem may be somewhat choosy to begin with, the trait is mainly a side effect of loneliness. Being lonely in the longer term naturally makes people unhappy, which can sour the way they view their interactions. It also makes them pessimistic and self-protective. They unconsciously think, "This isn't going to work out, so I won't let it get off the ground to begin with." They reject people before they can be rejected. 
<t>If you're really lonely, your initial goal should be to get some sort of social life going. As long as your potential friends aren't a total mismatch, consciously try to override your pickiness and hang out with anyone whom you get along with and who seems interested in spending time with you. Become friends with them first, and then decide if you want to continue the relationship. If you're too choosy, you can come up with reasons not to befriend just about anyone ahead of time. But if you push through your pickiness and start hanging out with someone, you'll often find you like their company, even if they didn't seem ideal on paper. 
<t>The first people you meet may not be your ideal friends, but the benefits of having a social life outweigh that. At the very least, it's easier to make more friends when you already have a few. You'll feel more confident about your social situation and be able to meet more people through your existing friends. Also, if you're forming your first-ever group of friends, you probably don't completely know what you like or want in that kind of relationship. You have to see firsthand what different types of people are like in a friend capacity. When your social life and friend-making skills are more established, then you can raise your standards. 
<t>Be especially cautious about rejecting people you really click with who don't fit the stereotypical image of a popular person. If you're insecure, you may reject them because you're overly concerned with how your friendship comes across to other people. You may also feel put off because you see traits in them, like being shy or having esoteric hobbies, that you're uncomfortable with in yourself. These relationships can teach you that spending time with a person you really get along with is more important and fulfilling than having a social circle that outsiders approve of. If your new friend is comfortable with the acceptable-but-sometimes-misunderstood traits you share, their attitude may rub off on you. If they have some negative facets to their personality, which you also have and feel insecure about, you may become more at peace with these traits when you can see they're just one part of your otherwise solid new friend. 

<h3>"I find it hard to make friends because I don't relate to the mentality and interests of most people"</h3>

Although not every less socially successful person feels alienated because they don't have the same interests as other people, it's not an incredibly rare issue either. In general, they typically feel most people are more shallow and superficial than they are. They have a distaste for seemingly popular interests like sports, celebrity gossip, trashy TV, fashion, drinking, and nightclubs, and see them as a sign of how much distance there is between them and the average vapid person. This sense of disconnect has consequences: 

•It is harder to form relationships when you don't relate to the things many people are into. Some interactions won't go well to begin with. A promising conversation may stall when you reply that you don't follow sports. You may be unfairly judged for not drinking. If you meet someone you click with, a wedge may appear when it becomes clear their first-choice activity every weekend is to go clubbing. 
•You may become too choosy and write off potential friends because you're quick to judge them as vacuous. 
•Your feelings may translate into bitter and misanthropic behavior. 
•Your sense of being different from everyone may morph into an arrogant belief that you're on a higher level than all the mindless sheep. Those feelings of false superiority may stay in your head as nothing more than an ego-protecting way to reframe your loneliness. Of course, if they appear as outward arrogance, that will put everyone off. 

<t>Here's how you can handle a sense of alienation:

•More than anything else, look for people who do think like you. They are out there. Plenty of people are intellectual or indifferent to sports or not into getting plastered. You can have a satisfying social life and never get drunk or go to a loud, flashy nightclub. 
•Be willing to give people more of a chance. Many of them aren't as shallow as they seem if you can look past the surface impression they create. 
•Try to soften your aversion to the activities you have a chip on your shoulder about. You don't have to love them, and you definitely don't have to do them, but work not to have such a hostile perception of them. It doesn't do you any favors to carry that kind of resentment around. 
•Stick to your values, but be open to the occasional compromise and generally approaching things in a less absolute way. It's fine if you don't like getting wasted or going to deafening, tacky clubs, but it's less realistic to try to keep alcohol or nightlife venues out of your life entirely. If your friends want to have a beer or two at a low-key pub, that's not so bad, and keeping them company there is better than not going out at all. 
•To be frank, if you feel superior to everyone, you need to get over yourself and develop a more humble, balanced self-image. Yes, you may be a bit more intellectual and refined than some of your peers, but it doesn't make you better than anyone. Many of them aren't nearly as dumb as you assume. Whatever your strengths are, you're not that much of a unique snowflake either. Being intelligent or having discerning taste is great, but people with those traits aren't that rare. Getting more social experience will drive all of this home. 

<t>Here are a few more thoughts to support some of those suggestions:

<b>Reasons people may seem more shallow than they are</b>

Many people who seem superficial do have deep interests or tendencies. The problem is that their surface features are easy to see, while their more substantial traits are hidden. Here are some things that may make layered, intelligent people come off as shallower at a glance, and cause you to pass on them too quickly:

•They belong to a social group that's stereotypically thought of as dumb and shallow. 
•They've fallen into a style of dressing that's associated with shallow people. 
•They have an accent or style of speaking that's stereotypically associated with less-cultured types. 
•They have a naturally crude, bubbly, or scatterbrained personality. 
•They don't use proper spelling and grammar when they text or email because they're more concerned with speed over perfect legibility. 
•They tend to act loud and dumb when they're drinking and having a good time. 
•They're in a place in their life where they want to do lots of shallow things like partying a lot. 
•They're capable of discussing heavy, cerebral topics, but have learned that those discussions can cause arguments or hurt feelings, so they save them for the appropriate time and place. 
•They're intelligent, but not interested in stereotypical intellectual topics like logical fallacies or Game Theory. 
•They're content in life, and not in an "ignorance is bliss" way. Some people think someone can only be deep if they're angsty, cynical, and preoccupied with existential questions. 
•Their thoughts are concealed. It's easy to think other people are less deep than you because you only see their surface behaviors. You, on the other hand, have access to all of your inner thoughts, many of which are profound and insightful. 
•They have good social skills. Some people go so far as to think that anyone who seems comfortable with social interaction, and who is at home in a group, is automatically a brainless follower. 

<b>In defense of "shallow" traits and interests</b>

In moderation, shallowness isn't inherently bad. If you're vapid to your core, that's no good, but in reasonable doses, shallow things are fine:

•Shallowness is part of the lighter side of socializing. Sometimes people want to make childish jokes and gossip about celebrities. It isn't better or worse than being reflective and serious, just different. 
•Shallow things can be fun. Most people enjoy the odd dumb movie or video game. Nothing wrong with that. 
•Shallow things can be a guilty pleasure. Lots of people realize that some of the things they like are fluffy and trashy, but they're enjoyable and harmless, so why not? 
•Shallow people can be fun. Even if you may never want to have a long, involved discussion with them, more vapid people can still be entertaining enough to idly chat with or to keep you company when you go out. 
•Some shallow things aren't really shallow at all. Sports and video games often get written off, but they're full of nuance and strategy. Real art, skill, and passion go into designing fashionable clothes. Some TV shows or comic books can have deeper plots than many people give them credit for at a glance. 
•Some shallow things have positive benefits. For example, a guy who gets into natural bodybuilding so he can take his shirt off at music festivals is improving his health in the process. 
•Some shallow things work for other people. Just because it may not appeal to you, it doesn't mean it isn't rewarding to someone else. For example, you may think a 9-to-5 job, a house in the suburbs, and 2.2 kids is soul sucking, but other people may find it fulfilling. 

<b>Some thoughts on developing a more balanced view of drinking</b>

To be very clear, nothing in this book is trying to tell you that you need to drink to be socially successful. If you have an overly angry black-and-white view of the activity, it's just trying to get you to see it through softer eyes. 
<t>If you're not into alcohol, look for friends who aren't big drinkers either. If you are in a social situation where people are pressuring you to drink, know you're doing nothing wrong and use the assertiveness skills covered in Chapter 23 to stand your ground. Feeling bitter about alcohol is particularly a problem around college age when it seems all everyone cares about is getting hammered. Realize that lots of people besides you aren't keen on drinking. The ones who are into getting wasted make a lot of noise about it and claim a disproportionate amount of attention, but not everyone is like that.
<t>Drinking isn't inherently bad. All kinds of people consume alcohol; many have a glass of wine with dinner. Sometimes you can think of drinking, any kind of drinking, as being more lowbrow or sinister than it is. It's more about how you go about it. There are different levels of alcohol consumption. Someone who has a beer or two while seeing some live music isn't consuming it on the same level as a guy who gets blackout drunk at a party and puts his hand through a window. It's often not drinking itself we feel negative about but the things it can become associated with. When you're young, underage drinking has all this baggage attached to it that it doesn't when you're 45 and sipping a scotch in the evening. You may have come to dislike drinking because it's a favorite activity of a type of person you resent. 
<t>It would be foolish to say there's nothing wrong with alcohol. It has a lot of potential downsides, from serious ones like addiction and drunk driving accidents, to more minor annoyances like losing your phone when you're loaded or putting on weight after two semesters of partying. However, most of the time nothing bad happens to people when they drink in moderation. They go out, share a few pitchers, feel the effects, and then head home for the night. Even when they get pretty drunk, most people still behave themselves. They may be louder, sloppier, and goofier than normal, but that's about it on most nights. If you're someplace where a lot of people are drinking, it's easy to spot the handful of people who are acting embarrassing or being self-destructive, but for every one of them, there are fifty who have their act together. 

<b>Some thoughts on developing a more balanced view of clubbing</b>

If you can take or leave giant, gaudy nightclubs, you're not alone. They can be loud, crowded, expensive, and full of people who aren't your style. Lots of people don't like them but still manage to have great social lives while setting foot in them as rarely as possible. As with drinking, complaints about clubbing are most commonly heard from people in their late teens and early twenties, when everyone is most enthusiastic about going to them. 
<t>Most people who go to clubs are good, regular folk. If you've been dragged to a club, it's easy to think that everyone but you is empty-headed and lives for that kind of scene, but a lot of people are occasional club-goers, who may have been cajoled into going too. The clubbing environment also makes people seem more ditzy than they are. Who doesn't come across as more superficial in a clubbing outfit? Everyone's also there to let loose and have fun, so they're not showing the more refined side of their personality. 
<t>Don't be too quick to dismiss specific aspects of clubbing. You may not like dancing to thumping dance music, but that doesn't automatically mean everyone who does is a mouth-breather. Similarly, many people go to clubs for face-value reasons like wanting to see their friends and cut loose after a long week. Not everyone has a less-flattering hidden motivation like wanting to get laid or soak up attention from strangers. Finally, not all clubs are the same. When people first start going out, they often gravitate to the biggest, most stereotypically club-ish clubs and mistakenly think they're all like that. You may not like huge venues that play Top 40 hits, but who's to say you wouldn't appreciate a smaller venue that plays more alternative music and attracts a crowd that's more your style?
