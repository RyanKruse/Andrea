<h2>The Overall Process of Improving Your Social Skills</h2>


<smallcaps>As you work to improve</smallcaps> your social skills, you must approach the process in the right way. Many people struggle to improve their social skills not because they're up against impossible challenges, but because they approach the task from the wrong angle and get unnecessarily discouraged. With the right mind-set, expectations, and approach to improving, you'll make more progress. This chapter covers some things you should know before working on your issues. Chapter 2 trouble-shoots some common questions and concerns people have about improving their social skills.

<h3>Figuring out which skills and traits to work on and which to leave alone</h3>

As the Introduction said, you don't need to change everything about yourself to do better socially. Of course, you'll want to address clear-cut problems that most people would be happy to be rid of​—​shyness and anxiety, low self-confidence, unpolished conversation skills, and lack of knowledge about how to make friends.
<t>The traits listed below can also cause social problems. They're all perfectly valid variations from the norm that you shouldn't have to change. However, they can lead to practical social inconveniences when either people misunderstand and look down on the traits, or the traits cause you to have competing needs.

<b>Acceptable, though sometimes impractical, social differences</b>

•Having an introverted personality.
•Liking to spend a lot of time alone.
•Not needing or wanting a ton of friends.
•Being selective when choosing who you want to be friends with.
•Preferring to socialize for shorter periods of time, and then head home to relax and recharge your batteries; having a tendency to get drained by socializing.
•Being into low-key types of socializing and choosing to avoid rowdy parties or getting drunk.
•Preferring to hang back and listen more in conversations, rather than talking a lot and trying to hold the spotlight.
•Not having a bubbly, expressive, excitable personality.
•Being able to take or leave aspects of socializing, like making chitchat with strangers waiting in a line with you.
•Preferring your conversations to have lots of substance.
•Being into "uncool," non-mainstream hobbies.
•Not caring about seemingly popular interests like team sports or reality TV.
•Living an alternative lifestyle or being part of a non-mainstream scene or subculture.
•Having beliefs and values that differ from the mainstream.
•Having a more quirky personality.

<t>As examples, having non-mainstream hobbies may hinder you if they cause your peers to stereotype you and write you off without giving you a chance. Liking to spend time alone may cause a conflict in your social goals. Part of you may want to go out more to make new friends, but your urge to hang out by yourself may get in the way.
<t>You'll have to decide for yourself how to approach your acceptable differences in light of your social goals. Wherever possible, you should be true to yourself and try to find your niche, which includes looking for friends who get you and like you for who you are.
<t>No one is socially perfect. As long as they bring enough positives to the table, they can still get by. If you read a piece of advice in this book you aren't crazy about following, ask yourself, "Would it make me happier on the whole to skip this suggestion? Could I handle the consequences of not following it?" For example, maybe you're at peace with having a blunter communication style and can live with the fact that it will occasionally put some people off. Maybe you'll even decide you're okay with aspects of your being mildly shy, even if it is technically a "problem." Be your own judge of what works for you.
<t>At times you may weigh the pros and cons of a situation and find it suits you to go along with certain social conventions. For example, in your perfect world you'd never devote a second of thought to fashion, but you realize other people value it and so learn to dress a little better. Or you like spending a lot of time alone, but you push yourself to be around people slightly more than you'd prefer so you have enough time to practice your social skills and be with your friends.
<t>You'll have to decide for yourself where you are and aren't willing to compromise. Changing isn't an option if something violates your deepest values or you outright dislike it. The pragmatic approach can work if you feel indifferent toward something and it doesn't take that much effort to go along with it. However, there are always going to be parts of the social world, where even if you realize intellectually it would be practical to go along with them, you're just not going to be able to play along. Most people aren't going to give up their religious or political views to fit in. As a lighter example, some men don't care about sports, but know they'd have an easier time relating to other guys if they were into them. Some never come to love sports, but can make themselves follow just enough news about game results and trades to grease their conversations. Others can't bring themselves to do even that, and they're fine living with the minor hassles that causes.

<h4>Keep an open mind</h4>

Although you don't need to completely change or sell yourself out to do better socially, you should try to keep an open mind. Be open to new experiences and the possibility that one day you may develop traits or come to appreciate things you never thought you'd enjoy. People change throughout their lives. It's important to be true to yourself, but not to the point where you become locked in place and dismiss anything new with "No, that's not who I am." Say a friend invites you to an introductory salsa class, and you've never done much dancing. Even if you sense it's not something you'd get a lot out of, it's too rigid to blindly say, "No, that's not me! I don't like dancing and never will!" You don't have to mindlessly try everything everyone suggests, but you never know​—​you may actually love partner dancing and just not realize it yet.

<h3>Realizing your interpersonal skills don't have to be flawless to have a satisfying social life</h3>

Countless people in the world have fun social lives even though they're a bit shy and insecure, or they sometimes stumble in their conversations, or they don't have a ton of fascinating hobbies, or they have a few irksome personality quirks. Even charismatic people make bad jokes or have their invites turned down. You don't need to perfectly execute every skill in this book 100 percent of the time, and you don't have to get every last person on the planet to like you. You just need to be good enough to get by and have friends who accept you for who you are. You don't need all of your interactions to go flawlessly. You just need enough of them to go well that you can meet your social goals (if you invite ten people to hang out and only three accept, but they go on to become your good friends, that's a win).

<h3>Practicing your social skills to improve them</h3>

Social skills are skills like any other. Reading advice can give you an idea of what you need to work on and help the learning process go more smoothly, but in the end you have to practice to really get things down. You've probably socialized for fewer overall hours than many of your peers, and you have to put in the time to catch up.
<t>That seems obvious, but when it comes to interpersonal skills, some people think they can be gained all at once through the right trick, insight, psychology "hack," or confidence booster. They likely think that because social skills are non-physical and mundane. People instinctively understand it takes time to learn complex physical abilities like skiing or drawing. However, when it comes to socializing, their thought process is, "It's just talking. I already know how to do that. So just give me some secret super-effective conversation formulas, and I'll be off to the races."
<t>Additionally, most people have found that navigating a social situation was easier when they were temporarily more confident than usual. So they figure there must be a way to be extra-confident all the time. However, although you can fleetingly become unusually self-assured, there's no way to call that feeling up on command or lock it in place for life. There really are no shortcuts. If there were, they'd be common knowledge, and this book wouldn't be needed.

<b>Knowing what are you working on when you practice your social skills</b>

As you practice socializing, you'll develop the following overall abilities. In some interactions, you'll draw on only a few of them, while other interactions will require you to juggle many at a time.

1)<b>Your ability to think on your feet.</b> When it's your turn to say something, you can't take forever to come up with your response. Also, aside from the relatively predictable first minute or two, interactions can quickly go in countless directions. It's unfeasible to try to plan out everything you're going to say ahead of time or map out how to handle every scenario in advance. The best you can do is learn some general guidelines and then sharpen your ability to improvise.
2)<b>Your ability to multitask.</b> When you're interacting with someone, you have to continually attend to several things at once. The other person is constantly sending signals through their words, actions, and nonverbal communication; you have to take it in, evaluate it, and decide on the fly how to act on your conclusions ("They just said they're not familiar with cycling. I'll have to adjust how I tell my anecdote."). At the same time, you have to manage the signals you're sending ("I'm curious about what time it is, but I won't check my watch now because it may make me look like I'm not interested in their story."). As you get better at socializing, taking in all of that information and deciding what to do with it starts to feel less overwhelming.
3)<b>Your proficiency in a variety of concrete subskills like listening, asserting yourself, or phrasing an invitation.</b> Like with any skill, at first you'll be clumsy and exaggerated when you listen actively, assert yourself, or extend an invitation, but in time you'll develop a defter touch and be able to calibrate your behavior to the situation at hand. For example, when you're first getting the hang of listening skills, you may sometimes come across as an over-the-top therapist. With more practice, you'll be able to show you care and that you're paying attention in a more subtle way.
4)<b>Your comfort level with various subskills, like making eye contact or starting conversations.</b> Some subskills, like making eye contact or initiating a conversation, will make you feel nervous or unnatural at first, but the more you do them, the more normal they'll feel.
5)<b>Your general knowledge of people, what makes them tick, and how they tend to react to various things.</b> Every person is different, but with enough social experience, you'll start to notice broad patterns you can act on. For example, you may notice that people who are into a certain hobby also tend to share the same political beliefs and conversation style, and you can adjust accordingly.
6)<b>Your knowledge of various social situations and how to navigate them.</b> You can learn this through firsthand experience or by observing other people who are more socially experienced than you. It's possible to find advice on common scenarios, like how to approach people at a party or turn down an unreasonable request, but in your day-to-day life, you'll come across other scenarios that are too rare and esoteric to end up in any book. When you come across these novel situations, you may not always handle them perfectly, but with time you can build up an overall sense about how to approach them.
7)<b>Your knowledge of the unwritten social guidelines of your particular culture, subculture, or group of friends, and how to adjust the general communication-skills rules to fit them.</b> This is another reason it's impossible to explain how to deal with every situation ahead of time. What may be considered an appealing conversation style in one country or among one circle of friends may be seen as obnoxious elsewhere. The only way to learn the rules for your social context is to be in it and observe them for yourself.
8)<b>Constructive mind-sets toward socializing.</b> A well-intentioned, but unhelpful, variety of social advice is to suggest you adopt useful, but easier-said-than-done, mind-sets like, "Don't care too much about people's opinions of you" or "Just go out to have fun and don't fret about how well you socialize." It's great if you can think like this, but you don't instantly acquire those worldviews just by reading they're good to have. Instead, as you socialize more and more, you'll have many small experiences and successes that show firsthand these are good ways to think, and you'll gradually add them into your worldview.
9)<b>Your personal social style.</b> There are some general guidelines for what makes for a better or worse interaction, but there isn't a single right way to socialize. Everyone has his or her own personality and strengths and weaknesses. There are usually multiple ways to handle any situation. What works well for another person may not fit you at all. Your friend may be good at cheering people up by being a good listener. You may be better at being funny and helping them take their mind off their worries.

<b>Ways to practice socializing</b>

You can practice your social skills in three ways. First, if you feel you're socially inexperienced all around, you can simply find ways to spend more time socializing. This method is unstructured, but you'll still learn new things from all the extra hours you'll rack up, and hone a variety of skills. You can:

•Socialize more with the people you already know (existing friends, coworkers, classmates, roommates, family members).
•Get a job that involves lots of interaction with people (for example, retail, restaurant server, bartender, call center, sales).
•Sign up for a volunteer position that involves socializing (for example, fundraising, talking to seniors, helping out at a festival).
•Join a club, team, or organization.
•Attend online-organized meet-ups (for example, from a forum you use, through sites like Meetup.com).
•Take advantage of natural opportunities to have brief, friendly interactions with people who are generally expected to be pleasant and chat with you, such as store clerks and restaurant server.
•Go to a venue where people can show up alone and be social with the other patrons (for example, a board game café, a pub or pool hall).
•Interact with people online (for example, chatting with people while playing a multiplayer game). Of course, this can't be a complete substitute for face-to-face practice, but it shouldn't be dismissed entirely either.
•If it's a realistic option, travel and stay in busy, social hostels.

<t>A second method is to practice in a deliberate, structured way, especially if you want to work on specific skills. For example, if you have trouble starting conversations, you could attend one online-organized meet-up a week and talk to at least five new people each time. If you have trouble with a specific type of interaction, like inviting someone out or turning down an unreasonable request, you could practice by role-playing the scenario with a friend or family member. Some organizations and counseling agencies run social skills training groups that provide opportunities to practice in a safe, supportive environment.
<t>A third way to practice socially is to take a class to learn a performance-oriented interpersonal skill like public speaking, acting, or improv or stand-up comedy. These more specialized skills don't fully carry over into day-to-day situations. A rehearsed, memorized speech isn't the same as a spontaneous, casual conversation. However, they still provide a lot of benefits. For example, speech classes may teach you how to project your voice and use confident body language. Performing in a play may help you deal with your nerves and fear of being on the spot. Improv teaches you to be more loose, playful, and spontaneous in your conversations. Many people also find they get a small confidence boost in their daily interactions from knowing they're getting the hang of a more intimidating skill like speaking in public.
<t>You don't have to spend a lot of time talking to strangers in public to practice your social skills. Some people think they have to chat with a bunch of randoms at the mall or grocery store. If you're specifically trying to get used to starting and carrying on conversations with people you don't know, that's one thing. If you generally want to rack up some social experience, talking to strangers is usually too stressful and inefficient. It's better to practice with people whom you know and are already somewhat comfortable with, or strangers you meet in more structured situations like an art class.

<h3>Indirectly improving your social success</h3>

Although directly addressing the less-practiced aspects of your social skills is essential, you can also indirectly help your cause by becoming a more well-rounded, knowledgeable, interesting person. This works in a "wax on, wax off" kind of way. Imagine you did nothing to directly practice your social skills for three months, but spent that time traveling, discovering new music, and learning to mountain bike. At the end of those three months, many social situations would likely go more smoothly for you. You'd have more to talk about and relate to people over, and you'd really notice a difference if you ended up in a conversation with a traveler, cyclist, or music fan. The struggles of traveling and learning to mountain bike would have increased your overall confidence or maybe made you more fun and adventurous. The experiences you had on vacation may have some cachet and make people want to chat more with you so they could learn more about them.
<t>That's not to say that if you pick up a bunch of new hobbies, you'll be able to duck out of the direct practice requirement. Also, some people hear this advice and they try to learn about and do everything, hoping to get the maximum social benefit. Of course that's not feasible.

<h3>Knowing how long it will take to catch up in your social skills</h3>

Of course, it's hard to estimate how much time you'll need to polish your social skills because everyone starts from a different place. One to three years is a reasonable amount of time to expect if you're behind all around, as opposed to needing help with a smaller area or two. It generally takes a few years to get half-decent at many skills.
<t>Reading that may leave you feeling discouraged: "It may take me three years? Are you kidding me?!" That estimate isn't meant to bring you down, but to be straight-forward and realistic about the process. In the long run, knowing what to expect prevents more discouragement than it creates. Hearing the news doesn't feel good up front, but when you're six months in and have a bad day, you can put it in perspective and not see it as a sign that you're hopeless. If this book falsely led you to believe social skills are quick and easy to obtain, you'd feel worse​—​and maybe even give up entirely​—​if everything didn't fall into place after a few weeks.
<t>One to three years may seem long, but the process of improving won't be a grind the entire time. As with learning anything, it will be roughest at the beginning and then get more enjoyable and comfortable once you've developed a basic foundation. It's like learning to play the guitar: In the first month it hurts your fingers to hold down the strings, and it's an accomplishment to play a chord properly, let alone to switch between several of them quickly and smoothly. At the six-month mark, the situation is far different. You're still a clueless beginner in the grand scheme of things, but you know enough that practicing isn't a complete struggle, and is often fun when you get the hang of a new song. It's the same with socializing. At first it may be nerve-racking to make polite chitchat with someone for a few minutes. A year in you may confidently head to a party with a bunch of friends and know you'll get in some mingling practice while you have a good time with everyone.
<t>Not all progress comes slowly either. Some areas are easier to make improvements in than others. For example, there are some simple, common mistakes people commit when trying to make friends, and after they know how to avoid them, their social lives often improve quickly.
<t>You have more time than it seems. Late bloomers often worry that their best years have passed them by and they've missed the window for having a fulfilling social life. That's not true at all. Social skills can be learned at any time in your life. After you're caught up, you're caught up. Learning social skills isn't like learning languages, where our brains are wired in such a way that it's harder to learn new ones after childhood. There's no door that closes when you reach 20, 25, 30, or any other arbitrary age. You will have opportunities to enjoy yourself and socialize throughout your life. If you're in your early twenties or younger, you may believe that after college all the fun dries up and everyone becomes boring and bogged down by responsibilities. Not true. People never stop socializing and having fun together.
<t>It can be frustrating to hear you have to wait before you can get what you want, but try not to succumb to impatience. If you're impatient, you may give up on helpful suggestions because they're not working instantly. You also might chase one supposed quick fix after another, instead of sticking with proven approaches that are slower and less glamorous. When you do get discouraged or impatient, remind yourself that social skills take time to develop; it's not realistic to expect to become an expert overnight. Also, look at where you are now compared to where you began. You'll be more likely to keep going when you can show yourself you're making improvements.

<h3>Expecting your emotions to swing up and down</h3>

You can broadly divide the process of putting your social problems behind you into an initial, more frustrating phase, and a later one where the sailing is smoother. As you improve your social skills, practicing them becomes easier and more encouraging, and you have a sense the worst is behind you​—​success is just a matter of time if you stay the course.
<t>Your moods can be rocky during that first phase. Whatever happens, you'll tend to read too much into what it means for the future. If you have a good day, you'll be overly excited and feel like you've finally turned a corner and everything will be okay. When you inevitably have an off day, you'll conclude you're hopeless and you'll never have better social skills.
<t>With more practice and a few more tastes of success, you'll calm down. You'll also realize that even if you have a few shaky interactions, your progress is still steadily ticking upward; if you keep at it, you'll get there eventually. One way to maintain perspective is to keep a record of your progress. That way you have an objective reminder that you're making positive changes ("I feel like I'm still as shy as I've always been, but it says this month I started more conversations than I ever have, and I've hung out with three new people.")

<h3>Realizing it's okay to seek professional support</h3>

This is a self-help book, but when it's appropriate, it will point out situations where it may be helpful to get some extra assistance from a counselor or support group. Sometimes you'll face challenges that are too difficult to deal with on your own. Seeing a professional isn't a shameful last resort for "weak," "broken," "crazy" people. It's just a way to get some knowledgeable experts on your side. If you're in college, your school may offer free counseling services. Many communities also have affordable mental health agencies.
