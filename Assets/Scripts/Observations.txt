Language Packs & Fallbacks:

If you see text not being displayed, then try swapping the language packs around or adding on more fallbacks.
More fallbacks increase the download size for the prefab. The memory size of each language pack varies - choose only what's necessary.
All fallbacks should be added to the Noto Sans and Noto Serif SDF files. These are the main language packs to handle fallbacks.
There are several dozen language packs pre-downloaded. They are located in the Noto Sans Addons and Noto Serif Addons folders.
Noto Sans has a more modern style of font. Noto Serif has a more traditional style of font.

When modifying an SDF file, you may need to drag-and-drop the SDF files into the inspectors components again (where they are populated) to update them.
Modifications include changing the fallbacks, atlas sizes, multi-atlas options, etc.
Deleting an SDF file and recompiling a new one from the original font type file requires drag-and-drop into the inspectors components again.
It also requires setting Atlas Width, Atlas Height, Multi-Atlas Textures, Clear Dynamic Data, and Resetting Fallbacks again.

Do not rename font type files (.ttf, .otf) until the font SDF files (.asset) have been generated.
Generating an font SDF file from a renamed font type file will create a mismatch and lead to run-time errors.
Once the SDF file has been generated, it is safe to rename files (.ttf, .otf, .asset).
You can generate a dynamic SDF file from a font type automatically by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + F12.
Save 20 mb on world download size by removing all fallbacks from text using Noto Sans. When using compiler with books that have such texts, need to re-add them.

WTF? PopulateStyleSheet in Compiler can utilize Andrea's code?
Changing font types too fast breaks the clones.
Scrolling too fast skips the clones (shows a blank screen loading in new block).
Scroll bar on main page (works in VR).

Loc 1960, Loc 2364, 2729, 3099, 3111, 4419, 5107, 5698 is strange on end clipping (wide text).
Loc 6276 needs to be broken up (huge word combo)
Quotes from questions asked on last chapters needs to be consistent in interviews.
Loc 6538 doesn't cut correctly?
