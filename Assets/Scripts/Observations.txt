Language Packs & Fallback Tips:

	- If you see text not being displayed, then try swapping the language packs around or adding on more fallbacks.
	- More fallbacks increase the download size for the prefab. 
    - The memory size of each language pack varies. Choose only what's necessary.
	- All fallbacks should be added to the Noto Sans and Noto Serif SDF files. These language packs handle fallbacks.
	- There are several dozen language packs pre-downloaded located in the Noto Sans Addons and Noto Serif Addons folders.
	- Noto Sans has a more modern style of font. Noto Serif has a more traditional style of font.

	- When modifying an SDF file, you may need to drag-and-drop the SDF files into the inspectors components again.
	- Modifications include changing the fallbacks, atlas sizes, multi-atlas options, etc.
	- Deleting an SDF file and recompiling a new one from the original font type file requires repopulation.
	- Requires setting Atlas Width, Atlas Height, Multi-Atlas Textures, Clear Dynamic Data, and Resetting Fallbacks again.

	- Do not rename font type files (.ttf, .otf) until the font SDF files (.asset) have been generated.
	- Generating an font SDF file from a renamed font type file will create a mismatch and lead to run-time errors.
	- Once the SDF file has been generated, it is safe to rename files (.ttf, .otf, .asset).
	- You can generate a dynamic SDF file from a font type automatically by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + F12.
	- Save 20 mb on world download size by removing all fallbacks from text using Noto Sans. 
    - When using compiler with books that have such texts, need to re-add them.
