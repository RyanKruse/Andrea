Language Packs & Fallbacks:

If you see text not being displayed, then try swapping the language packs around or adding on more fallbacks.
More fallbacks increase the download size for the prefab. The memory size of each language pack varies - choose only what's necessary.
All fallbacks should be added to the Noto Sans and Noto Serif SDF files. These are the main language packs to handle fallbacks.
There are several dozen language packs pre-downloaded. They are located in the Noto Sans Addons and Noto Serif Addons folders.
Noto Sans has a more modern style of font. Noto Serif has a more traditional style of font.

When modifying an SDF file, you may need to drag-and-drop the SDF files into the inspectors components again (where they are populated) to update them.
Modifications include changing the fallbacks, atlas sizes, multi-atlas options, etc.
Deleting an SDF file and recompiling a new one from the original font type file requires drag-and-drop into the inspectors components again.
It also requires setting Atlas Width, Atlas Height, Multi-Atlas Textures, Clear Dynamic Data, and Resetting Fallbacks again.

Do not rename font type files (.ttf, .otf) until the font SDF files (.asset) have been generated.
Generating an font SDF file from a renamed font type file will create a mismatch and lead to run-time errors.
Once the SDF file has been generated, it is safe to rename files (.ttf, .otf, .asset).
You can generate a dynamic SDF file from a font type automatically by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + F12.
Save 20 mb on world download size by removing all fallbacks from text using Noto Sans. When using compiler with books that have such texts, need to re-add them.

TODO:
Rotate arrow buttons.
Buttons don't include text panel. 
Rest button after getting tired of reading.

WTF? PopulateStyleSheet in Compiler can utilize Andrea's code? Can skip parallel code logistics.
Changing font types too fast breaks the clones (unsure about size).
Scrolling too fast skips the clones (shows a blank screen loading in new block).
Scroll bar on main page (works in VR).
Some sort of break button.

Something broken with images around Loc 785, Loc 1325, 2973 re-add paragraphs? in 7 Habits.
Loc 1960, Loc 2364, 2729, 3099, 3111, 4419, 5107, 5698 is strange on end clipping (wide text).
Loc 6276 needs to be broken up (huge word combo)
Quotes from questions asked on last chapters needs to be consistent in interviews.
Loc 6538 doesn't cut correctly?
Very last block doesn't load - errors out.

Re-add the proof-of-concept GUI. Allow rolling.

I use VRChat for 3 things. Sexual gratification. Social gratification. Contribution gratification. 

Depressive and Mania Cycle of Biopolar Disorder.
You need grit - Sticking to one thing.
You need deep work - No distractions.
You need values - Meaning to your project.

Start with Why:
When I was a rebellious child with no supervision or education, books were the only thing that kept me educated.
I would read the New York Times, I would read Goosebumps, I would read my history text book.
With mediums of communication becoming increasingly digital, having a book in your hands is becoming more scarce.
I would like to offer a book to someone in the virtual space, to extend them the same hand that guided me when I was growing up.
Maybe movies, TV shows, music, social media, and the plethora of content on the internet may drown up any interest in books.
I'd like to make it as easy and accessible as possible to those willing to give their time to reading.
And maybe I can help someone get through their childhood and grow up to be a happy, successful, well-minded adult.
