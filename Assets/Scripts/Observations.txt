Language Packs & Fallback Tips:

	- If you see text not being displayed, then try swapping the language packs around or adding on more fallbacks.
	- More fallbacks increase the download size for the prefab. 
    - The memory size of each language pack varies. Choose only what's necessary.
	- All fallbacks should be added to the Noto Sans and Noto Serif SDF files. These language packs handle fallbacks.
	- There are several dozen language packs pre-downloaded located in the Noto Sans Addons and Noto Serif Addons folders.
	- Noto Sans has a more modern style of font. Noto Serif has a more traditional style of font.

	- When modifying an SDF file, you may need to drag-and-drop the SDF files into the inspectors components again.
	- Modifications include changing the fallbacks, atlas sizes, multi-atlas options, etc.
	- Deleting an SDF file and recompiling a new one from the original font type file requires repopulation.
	- Requires setting Atlas Width, Atlas Height, Multi-Atlas Textures, Clear Dynamic Data, and Resetting Fallbacks again.

	- Do not rename font type files (.ttf, .otf) until the font SDF files (.asset) have been generated.
	- Generating an font SDF file from a renamed font type file will create a mismatch and lead to run-time errors.
	- Once the SDF file has been generated, it is safe to rename files (.ttf, .otf, .asset).
	- You can generate a dynamic SDF file from a font type automatically by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + F12.
	- Save 20 mb on world download size by removing all fallbacks from text using Noto Sans. 
    - When using compiler with books that have such texts, need to re-add them.

Oustanding Tasks:

Release Andrea first.
Perfection may endlessly have Candle v2 as main prototype. 
Add a "requested features" section to show you're not slacking.
Just submitting your first draft - same as submitting a first essay draft in college. 


Slightly increase character space as they get super clumped sometimes.
Music option for reading books.
White noise option for reading books.
Information tab - get it in other people's worlds.
Option to hold 
Z-fighting on back of tablet.
Left hand options.
Controller dead-space issue.
Pickup still iffy - need more user feedback.
Floaty.
Text to speech for tired readers.
Mirror in the world.
Grabbing tablet accidently big issue.
Multiple tablets with networking.
Hovering desktop cursor over slider doesn't show block title.

Maybe just super expand the back side info.
Include your discord info. Booth info. Basic tutorial.
Maybe on screen saver, remind people what loc they are on.
Slight complaint on the color of the tablet background "old color looking".
"This is where I was at! God, I have to remember what percent I was at in this book"
"There definently needs to be a save system in here. Makes it much easier."

Doesn't look like people are holding the book when they are reading in VR.
Need to have SOME networking on the book, otherwise multiple people can't read.
Usually it's just one person reading and the other people nagging that person for attention. 

Confusing that the Loc Change on Nav Slider released and takes to first page index instead of the block instead, not the actual loc itself.
Maybe should change to the actual loc itself. And have arrows left and right to go to first and last page of block.

Percent doesn't show when book loading from main menu.
Save data for users when they leave the world.
When one person grabs it, it automatically snaps to another person's hand.

Toggle pickup is apparently super, super scary to people.
Like, I cannot underestimate how scary of a first impression the tablet makes.
One single violation of expectation in first 5 seconds and it's like "this thing sucks."
Have to remove this feature as default, the violation is too much relative to power user convinence.
Add a "Toggle Pickup" with a hint explaining what it does.
Hint: Same dialog as the VRChat explaination for toggle pickup.

The super floatiness of the device is what people's first impression is when they pick it up. Another violation of expectation. Need to hint to the player to use laser to interact with main page. "Use laser cursor to interact." or "Interact using laser cursor." 

Stick drift makes experience for rift S users impossible. 
Maybe allow option to go to start of chapter after nav slider?
Replace "Brightness" slider with "Warmth" slider and perform same functionality?

Text Settings | Device Settings | 
Font Type | Tablet Size
Font Size | Toggle Tablet Pickup (resets if respawn)
Background Brightness | Toggle Player Movement (resets if respawn)

A thicker tablet black edges would actually be an advantage. I keep on peeking behind the tablet.


Networking using Truce VR logistics? Other people literally cannot use this thing in worlds more than one player since it is not setup for it. And their curiosity guides them to it. Make it realistic, local networking added. 





Virtual Reality.
+ Double check cube lerp.
+ Double check toggle pickup.
+ Left hand support.
+ Networking pickup.
+ Fast page scroll.
+ Screen saver logistics.
+ Buzz haptic feedback.
+ Scale Bug (***).
+ Scroll books don't work (players keep pressing image).

Desktop.
+ Hide mouse cursor.
+ Desktop Z Grid-Snap Rotation.

Andrea.
+ Tutorial multiple language.
+ People try to scroll holding the grey'd out books.
+ Simplify interface for developers.
+ Polish book block title headers.
+ If really laggy, clone delay appears to stick around too long.


Hell Code #4:
Options Menu
	- Smooth lerp on tablet scale.
	- Brightness (Light had 219/217/214 Background, 0/0/0 Font | Dark had 24/26/27 Background, 177/175/172 Font).
	- Scale still inconsistent with desktop and VR users.
	- Toggle Pickup Button.


Misc Code:
Respawn tablet button.
Style sheet on one of the quotes has texts really mushed together. Redo format entire style sheet?
Head position slightly jitters tablet - need to subtract that from calculations.


Something broken with images around Loc 785, Loc 1325, 2973 re-add paragraphs? in 7 Habits.
Loc 1960, Loc 2364, 2729, 3099, 3111, 4419, 5107, 5698 is strange on end clipping (wide text).
Loc 6276 needs to be broken up (huge word combo)
Quotes from questions asked on last chapters needs to be consistent in interviews.
Loc 6538 doesn't cut correctly?
Ensure no blue highlighters.
&amp error in HTWF Loc1100.
Loc 3710 Large Notosans Book Index 0... Bullet Break Didn't Work! Block: 12. Page Index: 7.
