I use VRChat for 3 things. Sexual gratification. Social gratification. Contribution gratification. 

Depressive and Mania Cycle of Biopolar Disorder.
You need grit - Sticking to one thing.
You need deep work - No distractions.
You need values - Meaning to your project.

Start with Why:
When I was a rebellious child with no supervision or education, books were the only thing that kept me educated.
I would read the New York Times, I would read Goosebumps, I would read my history text book.
With mediums of communication becoming increasingly digital, having a book in your hands is becoming more scarce.
I would like to offer a book to someone in the virtual space, to extend them the same hand that guided me when I was growing up.
Maybe movies, TV shows, music, social media, and the plethora of content on the internet may drown up any interest in books.
I'd like to make it as easy and accessible as possible to those willing to give their time to reading.
And maybe I can help someone get through their childhood and grow up to be a happy, successful, well-minded adult.
